What is Bluetooth™ wireless technology?
Bluetooth™ wireless technology is a global standard telecommunications format that enables data to be exchanged wirelessly between personal
computers, peripheral components, mobile telephones, and other electronic devices.
Registering devices having onboard Bluetooth™ wireless technology to let them communicate with one another will make it possible for data to be
readily exchanged between the devices. 
A maximum of seven Bluetooth™ wireless technology devices may be connected together. By using Bluetooth™ wireless technology to connect
to a mouse, keyboard, modem, printer, or other device, you can do away with messy cabling and avoid any concerns about space restrictions,
which will allow you to work more comfortably.

What you need to know about using Bluetooth™™ wireless technology
Bluetooth™ wireless technology exchanges data using radio waves.
The following points are critical in order for Bluetooth devices to be configured and used correctly. 

The devices must be Bluetooth™ wireless technology-compatible

The devices must be close enough to be able to communicate

The devices must be in a connectable state

No other radio wave-emitting devices should be operated nearby

The Bluetooth devices must be switched ON
The devices must be Bluetooth™ wireless technology-compatible
The hardware and software used in your PC and other devices must be Bluetooth™ wireless technology compatible.
Bluetooth™ wireless technology compatible products normally bear the following logo:
For further details, please refer to your local retailer or consult the product instruction manual. 
Note

A Bluetooth™ wireless technology communication card, adapter, or other similar device (sold separately) needs to be installed in PCs or
PDAs (personal digital assistants) that do not have onboard Bluetooth™ wireless technology.
The Bluetooth™ wireless technology devices must be able to communicate with each other
Devices situated in locations beyond the reach of the radio waves will not recognize each other, which will make communication impossible.
In particular, please ensure that your devices are located close enough so that they can communicate with each other before you initially register
and configure them. 
Note

PCs have a communication distance restriction of ten meters. Please refer to the instruction manuals for information on the communication
distance restrictions specific to each device.

Communication interference may occur if any obstructions are located between the devices. Devices may not communicate properly if they
have been located, for example, on the ground and first floors of a residence, despite their being within the acceptable distance. 
The devices must be in a connectable state
The devices must recognize each other in order to be connectable for use.
In certain devices, simply turning on the power will not produce a connectable state. Moreover, the energy-saving feature may come into effect
after a certain amount of time, which will prevent the devices from being detected. Please refer to the specific product instruction manual for further
details. 
No other radio wave-emitting devices should be operated nearby
Microwave ovens, wireless LANs, and other radio wave-emitting devices located nearby may affect Bluetooth™ wireless technology
communication.

Please ensure that your devices have been accordingly situated, and that the above devices are not in use when you are operating your Bluetooth
device.
The Bluetooth™ wireless technology devices must be switched ON
Bluetooth™ wireless technology cannot be used if the devices have not been switched ON.
Some PCs and other components will have a Bluetooth™ wireless technology communication switch that is operated independently from the main
power. Bluetooth™ wireless technology cannot function if this switch has been turned off.

Varieties of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices you can use
It is important to understand the concepts of "services" and "profiles" in order to determine whether an intended function can be properly utilized
when you use a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology device. 
What is a "profile"?
Examples of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices include mice and keyboards (input devices), printers (output devices), and wireless modems
(communication devices). Functions that can be utilized by such devices are called "services." 
In order for these services to be used reliably, Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices are provided with common specifications known as
"profiles."
For example, when a PC makes a connection to a device, it obtains the profile of the corresponding device and thereby ascertains which functions
(services) the device offers. 
As an example, imagine someone who travels overseas. 
The traveller is only able to converse properly with their counterpart if both speak a language (English, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) they both
understand.
However, no dialogue will occur if they do not share a common language.
In the above example, the traveller and his/her counterpart correspond to the devices, the languages to the profiles, and the dialogues between the
two people to the services. The former example refers to a situation where a service can be performed because the devices support a common
profile, whereas the latter example refers to a situation where a service cannot be performed because a common profile is not supported. 
In other words, you will be able to use Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices that have a profile supported by a PC (the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility in
this case).
If the profiles belonging to the device are not supported by the PC, the functions corresponding to those profiles will not be able to be utilized.
Also, a device can only be used if its profiles are supported by the PC. 
Types of profiles
The following profiles are supported by the Bluetooth
TM

Basic settings
Methods for registering new devices using the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility shall now be described.
As an example, a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-compatible mouse shall be connected and configured using [Bluetooth Settings].
[Bluetooth Settings] provides two set-up methods: "Express Mode" and "Custom Mode."

Express Mode
[Bluetooth Settings] will automatically detect and register services. If several services (profiles) are supported by the device, the service that
has been set to the highest priority shall be selected and registered.
Express Mode is normally recommended for device set-up.

Custom Mode
After having been detected, the services supported by the device are displayed as a list, from which you can select the desired function(s).
Custom Mode must be used to set up a device if, for example, you wish to use a modem station to send a fax (because in Express Mode, the
DUN profile will be automatically selected since it has a higher priority than the FAX profile).
The differences between setting up the same device (a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-compatible mouse) using Express Mode and Custom Mode
are described on the following pages.
