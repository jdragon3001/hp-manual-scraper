Chapter 1. Safety information
This chapter presents the following safety information that you need to be familiar with before you service a 
ThinkPad notebook computer.
•  “General safety” on page 1
•  “Electrical safety” on page 1
•  “Safety inspection guide” on page 3
•  “Handling devices that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge” on page 3
•  “Grounding requirements” on page 4
•  “Safety notices (multilingual translations)” on page 4
General safety
Follow these rules to ensure general safety:
•  Observe good housekeeping in the area of the machines during and after maintenance.
•  When lifting any heavy object:  
1.  Ensure that you can stand safely without slipping.
2.  Distribute the weight of the object equally between your feet.
3.  Use a slow lifting force. Never move suddenly or twist when you attempt to lift.
4.  Lift by standing or by pushing up with your leg muscles; this action removes the strain from the 
muscles in your back. Do not attempt to lift any object that weighs more than 16 kg (35 lb) or that you 
think is too heavy for you.
•  Do not perform any action that causes hazards to the customer, or that makes the equipment unsafe.
•  Before you start the machine, ensure that other service technicians and the customer's personnel are not 
in a hazardous position.
•  Place removed covers and other parts in a safe place, away from all personnel, while you are servicing the 
machine.
•  Keep your toolcase away from walk areas so that other people will not trip over it.
•  Do not wear loose clothing that can be trapped in the moving parts of a machine. Ensure that your sleeves 
are fastened or rolled up above your elbows. If your hair is long, fasten it.
•  Insert the ends of your necktie or scarf inside clothing or fasten it with a nonconductive clip, about 8 
centimeters (3 inches) from the end.
•  Do not wear jewelry, chains, metal-frame eyeglasses, or metal fasteners for your clothing, because metal 
objects are good electrical conductors.
•  Wear safety glasses when you are hammering, drilling, soldering, cutting wire, attaching springs, using 
solvents, or working in any other conditions that might be hazardous to your eyes.
•  After service, reinstall all safety shields, guards, labels, and ground wires. Replace any safety device that 
is worn or defective.
•  Reinstall all covers correctly before returning the machine to the customer.
•  Fan louvers on the machine help to prevent overheating of internal components. Do not obstruct fan 
louvers or cover them with labels or stickers.
Electrical safety
Observe the following rules when working on electrical equipment.
© Copyright Lenovo 2020 1

--- Page 8 ---
Important: 
•  Use only approved tools and test equipment. Some hand tools have handles covered with a soft material 
that does not insulate you when working with live electrical currents.
•  Many customers have, near their equipment, rubber floor mats that contain small conductive fibers to 
decrease electrostatic discharges (ESD). Do not use this type of mat to protect yourself from electrical 
shock.
•  Find the room emergency power-off (EPO) switch, disconnecting switch, or electrical outlet. If an electrical 
accident occurs, you can then operate the switch or unplug the power cord quickly.
•  Do not work alone under hazardous conditions or near equipment that has hazardous voltages.
•  Disconnect all power before:
–  Performing a mechanical inspection
–  Working near power supplies
–  Removing or installing main units
•  Before you start to work on the machine, unplug the power cord. If you cannot unplug it, ask the customer 
to power off the wall box that supplies power to the machine, and to lock the wall box in the off position.
•  If you need to work on a machine that has exposed electrical circuits, observe the following precautions:
–  Ensure that another person, familiar with the power-off controls, is near you. That person must be there 
to switch off the power, if necessary.
–  Use only one hand when working with powered-on electrical equipment; keep the other hand in your 
pocket or behind your back.
CAUTION: 
An electrical shock can occur only when there is a complete circuit. By observing the above rule, 
you may prevent a current from passing through your body.
–  When using testers, set the controls correctly and use the approved probe leads and accessories for 
that tester.
–  Stand on suitable rubber mats (obtained locally, if necessary) to insulate you from grounds such as 
metal floor strips and machine frames.
Observe the special safety precautions when you work with very high voltages. Instructions for these 
precautions are in the safety sections of maintenance information. Use extreme care when measuring high 
voltages.
•  Regularly inspect and maintain your electrical hand tools for safe operational condition.
•  Do not use worn or broken tools and testers.
•  Never assume that power has been disconnected from a circuit. First, check that it has been powered off.
•  Always look carefully for possible hazards in your work area. Examples of these hazards are moist floors, 
nongrounded power extension cables, power surges, and missing safety grounds.
•  Do not touch live electrical circuits with the reflective surface of a plastic dental mirror. The surface is 
conductive; such touching can cause personal injury and machine damage.
•  Do not service the following parts with the power on:
–  Power supply units
–  Pumps
–  Blowers and fans
–  Motor generators
–  Units similar to those listed above
This practice ensures correct grounding of the units.
•  If an electrical accident occurs:
–  Use caution; do not become a victim yourself.
–  Switch off power.
–  Send another person to get medical aid.

Safety inspection guide
The purpose of this inspection guide is to assist you in identifying potentially unsafe conditions. As each 
machine was designed and built, required safety items were installed to protect users and service 
technicians from injury. This guide addresses only those items. You should use good judgment to identify 
potential safety hazards due to attachment of non-ThinkPad features or options not covered by this 
inspection guide.
If any unsafe conditions are present, you must determine how serious the apparent hazard could be and 
whether you can continue without first correcting the problem.
Consider these conditions and the safety hazards they present: 
•  Electrical hazards, especially primary power (primary voltage on the frame can cause serious or fatal 
electrical shock)
•  Explosive hazards, such as a damaged CRT face or a bulging capacitor
•  Mechanical hazards, such as loose or missing hardware
To determine whether there are any potentially unsafe conditions, use the following checklist at the 
beginning of every service task. Begin the checks with the power off, and the power cord disconnected.
Checklist: 
1.  Check exterior covers for damage (loose, broken, or sharp edges).
2.  Turn off the computer. Disconnect the power cord.
3.  Check the power cord for: 
a.  A third-wire ground connector in good condition. Use a meter to measure third-wire ground 
continuity for 0.1 ohm or less between the external ground pin and the frame ground.
b.  The power cord should be the authorized type specified for your computer. Go to: 
https:// 
support.lenovo.com/partslookup
.
c.  Insulation must not be frayed or worn.
4.  Check for cracked or bulging batteries.
5.  Remove the cover.
6.  Check for any obvious non-ThinkPad alterations. Use good judgment as to the safety of any non- 
ThinkPad alterations.
7.  Check inside the unit for any obvious unsafe conditions, such as metal filings, contamination, water or 
other liquids, or signs of fire or smoke damage.
8.  Check for worn, frayed, or pinched cables.
9.  Check that the power-supply cover fasteners (screws or rivets) have not been removed or tampered 
with.
Handling devices that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge
Any computer part containing transistors or integrated circuits (ICs) should be considered sensitive to 
electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage can occur when there is a difference in charge between objects. 
Protect against ESD damage by equalizing the charge so that the machine, the part, the work mat, and the 
person handling the part are all at the same charge.
Notes: 
1.  Use product-specific ESD procedures when they exceed the requirements noted here.
Chapter 1. Safety information 3

--- Page 10 ---
2.  Ensure that the ESD protective devices you use have been certified (ISO 9000) as fully effective.
When handling ESD-sensitive parts:
•  Keep the parts in protective packages until they are inserted into the product.
•  Avoid contact with other people.
•  Wear a grounded wrist strap against your skin to eliminate static on your body.
•  Prevent the part from touching your clothing. Most clothing is insulative and retains a charge even when 
you are wearing a wrist strap.
•  Use a grounded work mat to provide a static-free work surface. The mat is especially useful when 
handling ESD-sensitive devices.
•  Select a grounding system, such as those listed below, to provide protection that meets the specific 
service requirement.  
Note: The use of a grounding system to guard against ESD damage is desirable but not necessary.
–  Attach the ESD ground clip to any frame ground, ground braid, or green-wire ground.
–  When working on a double-insulated or battery-operated system, use an ESD common ground or 
reference point. You can use coax or connector-outside shells on these systems.
–  Use the round ground prong of the ac plug on ac-operated computers.
Grounding requirements
Electrical grounding of the computer is required for operator safety and correct system function. Proper 
grounding of the electrical outlet can be verified by a certified electrician.

supported by this manual:
•  “Strategy for replacing FRUs” on page 21
–  “Strategy for replacing a hard disk drive or a solid-state drive” on page 21
–  “Important notice for replacing a system board” on page 22
–  “How to use error codes” on page 22
•  “Strategy for replacing FRUs for CTO, special-bid, and standard models” on page 22
–  “Product definition” on page 22
–  “FRU identification” on page 23
Important: 
•  Advise customers to contact the Lenovo Customer Support Center if they need any assistance in 
obtaining or installing any software fixes, drivers, and UEFI BIOS downloads. Telephone numbers for 
Lenovo Support are available at: 
https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/supportphonelist
•  System disassembly and reassembly videos that show the FRU removal or replacement procedures for 
the Lenovo authorized service technicians are available at:  
http://www.lenovoservicetraining.com/ion/
Strategy for replacing FRUs
Before replacing parts:
Ensure that all software fixes, drivers, and UEFI BIOS downloads are installed before you replace any FRUs 
listed in this manual.
After a system board is replaced, ensure that the latest UEFI BIOS is loaded to the system board before you 
complete the service action.
To download and install software fixes, drivers, and UEFI BIOS, go to 
https://support.lenovo.com and follow 
the instructions on the screen.
Use the following strategy to prevent unnecessary expense for replacing and servicing FRUs:
•  If you are instructed to replace a FRU but the replacement does not correct the problem, reinstall the 
original FRU before you continue.
•  Some computers have both a processor board and a system board. If you are instructed to replace either 
the processor board or the system board, and replacing one of them does not correct the problem, 
reinstall that board, and then replace the other one.
•  If an adapter or a device consists of more than one FRU, any of the FRUs might be the cause of the error. 
Before replacing the adapter or device, remove the FRUs, one by one, to see if the symptoms change. 
Replace only the FRU that changed the symptoms.
Strategy for replacing a hard disk drive or a solid-state drive
Always try to run a low-level format operation before replacing a hard disk drive or a solid-state drive. This
