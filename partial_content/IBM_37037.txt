Multitasking:
 
To
 
allow
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
of
 
multiple
 
hard
 
drives
 
whenever
 
possible,
 
the
 
FDAT
 
module
 
is
 
written
 
as
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
multitasking
 
functions.
 
Each
 
drive
 
under
 
test
 
can
 
run
 
the
 
same
 
test
 
or
 
run
 
a
 
different
 
test
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
 
Each
 
subtest
 
is
 
written
 
to
 
handle
 
a
 
single
 
test
 
pass
 
and
 
all
 
test
 
variables
 
are
 
kept
 
track
 
of
 
in
 
a
 
structure
 
unique
 
for
 
each
 
drive
 
.
 
However,
 
when
 
testing
 
IDE
 
drives,
 
FDAT
 
will
 
not
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
of
 
IDE
 
drives
 
that
 
are
 
attached
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
IDE
 
cable.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
FDAT
 
is
 
testing
 
four
 
IDE
 
drives
 
on
 
a
 
PC,
 
it
 
will
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
on
 
drives
 
1
 
and
 
3
 
first
 
(master
 
drives),
 
then
 
perform
 
tests
 
on
 
2
 
and
 
4
 
(slave
 
drives).
 
FDAT
 
will
 
also
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
on
 
a
 
master
 
and
 
slave
 
that
 
are
 
on
 
separate
 
IDE
 
cables,
 
but
 
will
 
not
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
tests
 
on
 
a
 
master
 
and
 
slave
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
IDE
 
cable.
 
This
 
generally
 
increases
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
needed
 
to
 
test
 
multiple
 
IDE
 
drives.
 
Another
 
limitation
 
of
 
FDAT’S
 
multitasking
 
capability
 
is
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
Ultra
 
DMA
 
(UDMA).
 
Only
 
one
 
drive
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
can
 
access
 
the
 
UDMA
 
channel
 
and
 
the
 
UDMA
 
channel
 
buffer
 
must
 
be
 
kept
 
high
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
speed
 
advantage
 
over
 
other
 
data
 
transfer
 
modes.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
UDMA
 
channel
 
during
 
testing,
 
users
 
must
 
disable
 
the
 
multitasking
 
feature.
 
Destructive
 
vs
 
non-destructive
 
testing:
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
tests
 
found
 
in
 
FDAT
 
are
 
non-destructive.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
PCDR
 
will
 
preserve
 
any
 
data
 
that
 
is
 
present
 
on
 
the
 
tested
 
media
 
prior
 
to
 
beginning
 
any
 
destructive
 
operations
 
(i.e.
 
write
 
operations).
 
However,
 
users
 
can
 
run
 
certain
 
tests
 
in
 
destructive
 
mode
 
(i.e.
 
surface
 
scan
 
tests).
 
Destructive
 
tests
 
will
 
speed
 
up
 
testing
 
because
 
FDAT
 
does
 
not
 
preserve
 
the
 
data
 
on
 
the
 
media
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
test
 
beginning.
 
Unlike
 
non-destructive
 
tests,
 
any
 
data
 
present
 
on
 
the
 
media
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
test
 
beginning
 
is
 
lost.
 
FDAT
 
allows
 
for
 
enabling
 
or
 
disabling
 
destructive
 
tests,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
specifying
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
destructive
 
and
 
non-destructive
 
sectors
 
on
 
the
 
tested
 
drive.
 
This
 
is
 
done
 
through
 
the
 
configuration
 
of
 
the
 
FDAT.INI
 
.If
 
destructive
 
and
   
28

--- Page 35 ---
non-destructive
 
ranges
 
somehow
 
overlap,
 
then
 
the
 
overlapped
 
area
 
is
 
considered
 
non-destructive.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
users
 
specify
 
both
 
destructive
 
and
 
non-destructive
 
ranges
 
as
 
the
 
same,
 
then
 
the
 
entire
 
drive
 
is
 
tested
 
as
 
non-destructive.
