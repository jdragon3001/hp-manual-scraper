•  Do not turn your computer over when the ac power adapter is plugged in, otherwise, it could break the 
adapter plug.
•  Before moving your computer, be sure to remove any media, turn off attached devices, and disconnect 
cords and cables.
•  When picking up your open computer, hold it by the bottom. Do not pick up or hold your computer by the 
display.
•  Only an authorized ThinkPad repair technician should disassemble and repair your computer.
•  Do not modify or tape the latches to keep the display open or closed.
•  Avoid directly exposing your computer and peripherals to the air from an appliance that can produce 
negative ions. Wherever possible, ground your computer to facilitate safe electrostatic discharge.
Cleaning your computer
It is a good practice to clean your computer periodically to protect the surfaces and ensure trouble-free 
operation.
Cleaning the computer cover: Wipe it with a lint-free cloth dampened in mild soap and water. Avoid 
applying liquids directly to the cover.
Cleaning the keyboard: Wipe the keys one by one with a lint-free cloth dampened in mild soap and water. If 
you wipe several keys at a time, the cloth might hook onto an adjacent key and possibly damage it. Avoid 
spraying cleaner directly onto the keyboard. To remove any crumbs or dust from beneath the keys, you can 
use a camera blower with a brush or use cool air from a hair dryer.
Cleaning the computer screen: Scratches, oil, dust, chemicals, and ultraviolet light can affect the 
performance of your computer screen. Use a dry, soft lint-free cloth to wipe the screen gently. If you see a 
scratchlike mark on your screen, it might be a stain. Wipe or dust the stain gently with a soft, dry cloth. If the 
stain remains, moisten a soft, lint-free cloth with water or eyeglass cleaner, but do not apply liquids directly 
to your computer screen. Ensure that the computer screen is dry before closing it.

Chapter 4. Security
This chapter provides information about how to protect your computer from unauthorized use.
Using passwords
This topic provides information about how to use the power-on password, supervisor password, and hard 
disk password.
Passwords introduction
You can help prevent your computer from unauthorized use by using passwords. After you set a password, a 
prompt is displayed on the screen each time you turn on the computer. Enter your password at the prompt. 
You cannot use the computer unless you type the correct password.
If you have set a power-on password, a supervisor password, or a hard disk password, it unlocks 
automatically when the computer resumes from sleep mode.
Note: If a Windows password has been set, you are prompted to enter it when the computer resumes from 
sleep mode.
Power-on password
You can set a power-on password to help protect your computer against unauthorized access.
If you set a power-on password, the password prompt is displayed on the screen whenever you turn on the 
computer. You must enter the correct password to start using the computer.
When this icon 
is displayed, type a power-on password or a supervisor password.
Supervisor password
The supervisor password protects the system information stored in the ThinkPad Setup program. It provides 
the following security features: 
•  If only a supervisor password is set, a password prompt is displayed when you try to start the ThinkPad 
Setup program. Unauthorized users cannot change most of the system configuration options in the 
ThinkPad Setup program without the password.
•  The system administrator can use the supervisor password to access a computer even if the user of that 
computer has set a power-on password. The supervisor password overrides the power-on password.
•  The system administrator can set the same supervisor password on many ThinkPad notebook computers 
to make administration easier.
Hard disk passwords
Setting a hard disk password prevents unauthorized access to the data on the hard disk drive. When a hard 
disk password is set, you are prompted to type a valid password each time you try to access the hard disk 
drive.
The following two types of hard disk passwords can help protect the information stored on the storage drive: 
•  User hard disk password
© Copyright Lenovo 2018 41

--- Page 48 ---
If a user hard disk password has been set, but no master hard disk password has been, the user must 
enter the user hard disk password to access files and applications on the storage drive.
•  Master hard disk password
The master hard disk password also requires a user hard disk password. The master hard disk password 
is set and used by a system administrator. It enables the administrator to access any storage drive in a 
system like a master key. The administrator sets the master password; then assign a user password for 
each computer in the network. The user can then change the user password as desired, but the 
administrator still can get access by using the master password.
When a master hard disk password is set, only the administrator can remove the user hard disk password.
When this icon 
is displayed, type a user hard disk password. To type a master hard disk password, 
press F1. When the icon changes to 
, type the master hard disk password. To return to the icon 
, press F1 again.
Tips on using the hard disk passwords: 
•  You can set the minimum length of a hard disk password.
•  If you set a hard disk password of over seven characters, the storage drive can be used only with a 
computer that can recognize a hard disk password of over seven characters. If you then install the storage 
drive in a computer that cannot recognize a hard disk password that contains more than seven 
characters, you cannot access the drive.
•  Record your password and store it in a safe place. If you forget the user hard disk password, or both user 
and master hard disk passwords, Lenovo cannot reset your passwords or recover data from the storage 
drive. You must take your computer to a Lenovo reseller or a marketing representative to have the storage 
drive replaced. Proof of purchase is required, and a fee will be charged for parts and service.
Notes: The eDrive storage drives or Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal-compliant storage drives provide 
self-encryption capabilities to secure your data.

Hard disk security
To protect the computer from unauthorized security attacks, refer to the following tips to enhance security:
•  Set a power-on password as well as a hard disk password. For security, a longer password is 
recommended.
•  The storage drive built into your computer can be protected by UEFI BIOS. To provide reliable security, 
use the security chip and a security program with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) management 
feature. See “Setting the security chip” on page 43.
•  If a Disk Encryption storage drive is installed in your computer, ensure to protect the contents of your 
computer from unauthorized access by use of drive encryption software, such as Microsoft Windows 
BitLocker
® 
Drive Encryption.
•  Before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer, delete the data stored on it. For more 
information, see “Deleting data from your storage drive” on page 46.
Using Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption
To help protect your computer against unauthorized access, use the drive encryption software, such as 
Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption.
Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption (referred to as BitLocker) is an integral security feature of some editions 
of the Windows operating system. It can help you protect the operating system and data stored on your 
computer, even if your computer is lost or stolen. BitLocker can encrypt all user and system files, including 
the swap and hibernation files.
BitLocker uses the TPM to provide enhanced protection for your data and to ensure early boot component 
integrity. A compatible TPM is defined as a V2.0 TPM.
To check the BitLocker status, go to Control Panel, view Control Panel by Category, and click System and 
Security ➙ BitLocker Drive Encryption.
For more information, see the help system of the Windows operating system, or search for “Microsoft 
Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Step-by-Step Guide” on the Microsoft Web site.
Encryption solid-state drive
Some models contain the Encryption solid-state drive or Encryption hybrid drive. This encryption technology 
helps to protect your computer against security attacks on media, NAND flash, or device controllers by use 
of a hardware encryption chip. For the efficient use of the encryption feature, set a hard disk password for 
the internal storage drive.
Setting the security chip
Strict security requirements are imposed on network client computers that transfer confidential information 
electronically. Depending on the options you ordered, your computer might have an embedded security chip 
(a cryptographic microprocessor). With the security chip, you can do the following: 
•  Protect your data and system
•  Strengthen access controls
•  Secure communications

chip to Active. Otherwise, the Clear Security Chip option is not displayed.
Using the fingerprint reader
Depending on the model, your computer might have a fingerprint reader. Fingerprint authentication can 
replace your passwords, such as the Windows password, power-on password, and hard disk password. In 
this way, you can log in to your computer simply and securely.
Enrolling your fingerprints 
To enable fingerprint authentication, enroll your fingerprints first. During the enrollment, the fingerprints are 
associated with the Windows password automatically. It is recommended that you enroll more than one 
fingerprint in case of any injuries to your fingers. 
To enroll your fingerprints, do the following:  
1.  Open the Start menu and then click Settings ➙ Accounts ➙ Sign-in options.
2.  Follow the instructions on the screen to finish the enrollment.
Scanning your finger
To scan your finger, tap the fingerprint reader with the top joint of your finger and hold your finger there for 
one or two seconds with a little pressure. Then lift the finger to complete one scan. 
44 P1 and X1 Extreme User Guide

--- Page 51 ---
Fingerprint reader indicator
1  Off: The fingerprint reader is not ready for tapping.
2  Solid white: The fingerprint reader is ready for tapping.
3  Amber, blinking: The fingerprint cannot be authenticated.
Associating your fingerprints with your power-on password and hard disk password
To associate your fingerprints with your power-on password and hard disk password, manually create a 
connection by doing the following: 
1.  Turn off and then turn on the computer.
2.  When prompted, scan your finger on the fingerprint reader.
3.  Enter your power-on password, hard disk password, or both as required. The connection is created.
When you start the computer again, you can use your fingerprints to log in to the computer with no need to 
enter your Windows password, power-on password, and hard disk password. To change the settings, go to 
the ThinkPad Setup program. See “Using the ThinkPad Setup program” on page 51.
Attention: If you always use your fingerprint to log in to the computer, you might forget your passwords. 
Write down your passwords, and keep them in a safe place. If you forget your power-on password, you must 
take your computer to a Lenovo-authorized servicer or a marketing representative to have the password 
canceled. If you forget your hard disk password, Lenovo cannot reset your password or recover data from 
the storage drive. You must take your computer to a Lenovo-authorized servicer or a marketing 
representative to have the storage drive replaced. Proof of purchase is required, and a fee will be charged for 
parts and service.
Maintaining the fingerprint reader
The following actions could damage the fingerprint reader or cause it not to work correctly: 
•  Scratching the surface of the reader with a hard, pointed object
•  Scraping the surface of the reader with your fingernail or anything hard
•  Using or touching the reader with a dirty finger
If you notice any of the following conditions, gently clean the surface of the reader with a dry, soft, lint-free 
cloth: 
•  The surface of the reader is dirty or stained.
•  The surface of the reader is wet.
Chapter 4. Security 45

--- Page 52 ---
•  The reader often fails to enroll or authenticate your fingerprint.
If your finger has any of the following conditions, you might not be able to register or authenticate it: 
•  Your finger is wrinkled.
•  Your finger is rough, dry, or injured.
•  Your finger is stained with dirt, mud, or oil.
•  The surface of your finger is different from the one when you enrolled your fingerprint.
•  Your finger is wet.
•  Your finger that you are currently using has not been enrolled before.
To improve the situation, try the following: 
•  Clean or wipe your hands to remove any excess dirt or moisture from the fingers.
•  Enroll and use a different finger for authentication.
Deleting data from your storage drive
Some of the data stored on the storage drive might be sensitive. Handing your computer over to someone 
else without deleting the installed software, such as operating systems and programs, might even violate the 
license agreements. Be sure to delete data stored on the storage drive before you dispose of, sell, or hand 
over your computer.
You can use the following methods to delete data from the storage drive: 
•  Move the data to the Recycle Bin, and then empty the Recycle Bin.
•  Format your storage drive, using the software to initialize it.
•  Use the recovery program provided by Lenovo to bring the storage drive back to the factory default 
settings.
These operations, however, only change the file location of the data; they do not delete the data itself. The 
data is still there, even though it seems to be lost. Thus, it is sometimes possible to read the data by use of 
special software for data recovery. There is a risk that people of bad faith might read and misuse the critical 
data on storage drives for unexpected purposes.
To prevent leakage of data, it is important that you delete all the data from the storage drive when you 
dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer. You can destroy the data physically by smashing the storage 
drive with a hammer, or magnetically by means of strong magnetic power, thus making the data unreadable. 
But it is recommended that you use the software (payware) or service (pay service) developed for that 
purpose. The process might take several hours.
For disposing of data on the solid-state drive, Lenovo provides the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the 
Cryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool.
Some computers might support a Encryption solid-state drive and have such a drive installed. You can 
logically dispose of all the data on the drive in a short time by erasing the cryptographic key. The data 
encrypted with the old key is not physically erased but remains on the drive; however, it cannot be decrypted 
without the old key. This feature is also available with the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the Cryptographic 
Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool.

Installing device drivers
Device drivers are programs that contain instructions for the operating system about how to operate or 
“drive” a certain piece of hardware. Each hardware component on your computer has its own specific driver. 
If you add a component, the operating system must be instructed on how to operate that piece of hardware. 
After you install the driver, the operating system can recognize the hardware component and understand 
how to use it.
Note: Because drivers are programs, like any other file on your computer, they are susceptible to corruption 
and might not perform properly if corruption occurs.
It is not always necessary to download the latest drivers. However, you should download the latest driver for 
a component when you notice poor performance from that component or when you added a component. 
This action might eliminate the driver as the potential cause of a problem.
Getting the latest drivers from the Web site
You can download and install updated device drivers from the Lenovo Support Web site by doing the 
following: 
1.  Go to 
https://support.lenovo.com.
2.  Select the entry for your computer and then follow the instructions on the screen to download and install 
necessary software.
Getting the latest drivers using Lenovo Vantage
The system update function of Lenovo Vantage helps you keep the software on your computer up-to-date. 
Update packages are stored on Lenovo servers and can be downloaded from the Lenovo Support Web site. 
Update packages can contain applications, device drivers, UEFI BIOS flashes, or software updates. When 
Lenovo Vantage connects to the Lenovo Support Web site, the program automatically recognizes the 
following information and determines what updates are available for your computer:  
•  Machine type and model of your computer
•  Installed operating system
•  Language of the operating system
Lenovo Vantage then displays a list of update packages and categorizes each update as critical, 
recommended, or optional to help you understand the importance. You have complete control of which 
updates to download and install. After you select the update packages you want, Lenovo Vantage 
automatically downloads and installs the updates.
Lenovo Vantage is preinstalled on your computer and is ready to run. The only prerequisite is an active 
Internet connection. You can start the program manually, or you can use the schedule feature to enable the 
program to search for updates automatically at specified intervals. You also can predefine scheduled 
updates to search by the critical severity level so the list you choose from contains only those update types 
that you need.
For more information about how to use Lenovo Vantage, see the help system of the program.

Using system management
This topic is primarily intended for the network administrators.
Your computer is designed for manageability, so that you can redirect more resources to better meet your 
business objectives.
This manageability, known as total cost of ownership (TCO), enables you to remotely operate client 
computers in the same way as you operate your own computer, such as turning on a client computer, 
formatting a storage drive, and installing a program.
Once the computer is configured and operational, you can manage it by using the software and the 
manageability features that are already integrated into the client computer and the network.
Desktop Management Interface
The UEFI BIOS of your computer supports an interface called System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) 
Reference Specification, version 2.8 or later. SMBIOS provides information about the hardware components 
64
P1 and X1 Extreme User Guide

--- Page 71 ---
of your computer. It is the responsibility of the UEFI BIOS to provide information about itself and the devices 
on the system board. This specification documents the standards for getting access to this BIOS 
information.
Preboot eXecution Environment
The Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) technology makes the computer more manageable by enabling 
the computer to start from a server. Your computer supports the personal computer functions that PXE 
requires. For example, with the appropriate LAN card, your computer can be started from the PXE server. 
Note: The Remote Initial Program Load (RIPL or RPL) function cannot be used with your computer.
Wake on LAN
The network administrator can turn on a computer from a management console by using the Wake on LAN 
feature.
When the Wake on LAN feature is enabled, many operations, such as data transfer, software updates, and 
flash updates of the UEFI BIOS, can be done remotely without remote attendance. The updating process can 
perform after normal working hours and on weekends, so that the users are not interrupted during work, and 
the LAN traffic is kept to a minimum. It saves time and increases productivity. 
If the computer is turned on through Wake on LAN, the computer starts follow the Network Boot sequence.
Asset ID EEPROM
The Asset ID EEPROM contains information about the computer configuration and the serial numbers of the 
key components. It also includes a number of blank fields where you can record information about the end 
users in your network.
To enable a network administrator to remotely control your computer, set the following system-management 
features in the ThinkPad Setup program:  
•  Wake on LAN
•  Network Boot sequence
Note: If a supervisor password has been set, you are required to enter the supervisor password when you 
start the ThinkPad Setup program.
Enabling or disabling the Wake on LAN feature
When the Wake on LAN feature is enabled and the computer is connected to a LAN, the network 
administrator can start the computer remotely from a management console, using a remote network- 
management program.

Chapter 6. Configuring RAID
This chapter provides information about storage drive requirements for Redundant Array of Independent 
Disks (RAID) levels, and instructions on how to configure RAID for your computer.
An Introduction to RAID
RAID is a technology that provides increased storage functions and reliability through redundancy.
When a group of independent physical storage drives is set up to use RAID technology, they are in a RAID 
array. This array distributes data across multiple storage drives, but the array appears to the host computer 
as one single storage unit. Creating and using RAID arrays provides high performance, such as the expedited 
I/O performance, because several drives can be accessed simultaneously.
RAID drive groups configured according to certain RAID levels also improve data storage reliability and fault 
tolerance compared with single-drive storage systems. Data loss resulting from a drive failure can be 
prevented by reconstructing missing data from the remaining drives.
Note: For RAID 0, the missing data resulting from a drive failure cannot be reconstructed.
Storage drive requirements for RAID levels
Ensure that your computer has two identical storage drives installed (two M.2 NVMe solid-state drives with 
the same capacity) for supported RAID levels. If only one drive is installed, or two different types of drives are 
installed, the following information does not apply. 
Your computer supports the following RAID levels: 
•  RAID 0: striped disk array
–  Consists of two identical storage drives 
–  Supported strip size: 4 KB, 8 KB, 16 KB, 32 KB, 64 KB, or 128 KB
–  Better performance without fault tolerance
–  Higher risk of data loss resulting from a member drive failure compared with non-RAID configuration
•  RAID 1: mirrored disk array
–  Consists of two identical storage drives 
–  Improved reading performance and 100% redundancy

Chapter 7. Troubleshooting computer problems
This chapter provides information about what to do if you experience a problem with your computer.
General tips for preventing problems
This topic provides the following tips to help you prevent computing problems: 
•  Empty your recycle bin on a regular basis.
•  Use a disk defragment tool regularly on your storage drive to improve data seek and read times.
•  To free up disk space, uninstall unused programs. You also might want to look for program duplication or 
overlapping versions.
•  Clean out your Inbox, Sent, and Trash folders from your e-mail client program.
•  Back up your data at least once a week. If critical data is present, it is a good idea to back up the data 
daily. Lenovo has many backup options available for your computer. 
•  Schedule system restore operations to take a system snapshot periodically. For information about system 
restore, see Chapter 8 “Recovery information” on page 85.
•  Go to 
https://support.lenovo.com to download and install updates for the device drivers and UEFI BIOS 
when needed.
•  Keep up to date for device drivers on other non-Lenovo hardware. Before updating device drivers, read 
the device driver information release notes for compatibility or known issues.
•  Keep a log book. Entries might include major hardware or software changes, driver updates, minor issues 
you have experienced, and how you resolved the minor issues.
•  If you ever need to run a recovery on your computer to return the preinstalled contents onto the machine, 
the following tips might help along the way: 
1.  Remove all external devices such as the printer and keyboard.
2.  Ensure that your battery is charged and your computer has the ac power connected.
3.  Access ThinkPad Setup and load the default settings.
4.  Restart the computer and start the recovery operation.
5.  If your computer uses discs as the recovery media, do not remove the disc from the drive until 
prompted to do so.
Diagnosing problems
Many computer problems can be solved without outside assistance. If you experience a problem with your 
computer, the first place to start is the troubleshooting information in your computer documentation. If you 
suspect a software problem, see the documentation, including readme files and help information systems, 
that come with the operating system or program. ThinkPad notebook computers come with a set of 
diagnostic programs that you can use to help you identify hardware problems.
Note: If you are unable to isolate and repair the problem yourself after running Lenovo Vantage, save and 
print the log files created by the program. You need the log files when you speak to a Lenovo technical 
support representative.
Lenovo Vantage supports the hardware scan function. It combines diagnostic tests, system information 
collection, security status, and support information, along with hints and tips for optimal system 
performance. To run Lenovo Vantage, see “Accessing Lenovo programs” on page 11.
© Copyright Lenovo 2018 71

The troubleshooting information or the diagnostic programs might tell you that you need additional or 
updated device drivers or other software. You can get the latest technical information and download device 
drivers and updates from the Lenovo Support Web site at:
https://support.lenovo.com
For additional information, see the help system of the program.
Troubleshooting
If your computer has an error, it typically displays a message or an error code, or makes a beep when you 
turn it on. When you experience a problem, see the corresponding symptom and solution in this topic to try 
to solve the problem by yourself. 
Computer stops responding
Print these instructions now and keep them with your computer for reference later.
Problem: My computer is unresponsive (I cannot use the ThinkPad pointing device or the keyboard).
Solution: Do the following: 
1.  Press and hold the power button until the computer turns off. If you cannot turn off the computer by 
pressing the power button, reset the computer by inserting a straightened paper clip into the 
emergency-reset hole in the bottom of the computer. After the computer is turned off, restart the 
computer by pressing the power button. If the computer does not turn on, continue with step 2.
2.  Remove all power sources from the computer. Reattach the ac power adapter and restart the computer. 
If the computer does not start up, continue with step 3.
3.  While the computer is turned off, remove all power sources from the computer and remove all external 
devices that are attached to the computer (keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, and so on). Reattach the 
ac power adapter and restart the computer. If the computer still does not start up, call the Customer 
Support Center.
Spills on the keyboard
Problem: I spill something on the computer. 
Solution: Because most liquids conduct electricity, liquid spilled on the keyboard could create numerous 
short circuits and damage your computer. To solve the problem, do the following: 
1.  Ensure that no liquid creates a short circuit between you and the ac power adapter (if in use).
2.  Carefully unplug the ac power adapter immediately.
3.  Turn off the computer immediately. If the computer does not turn off, remove the removable battery. The 
more quickly you stop the current from passing through the computer the more likely you will reduce 
damage from short circuits.  
Attention: Although you might lose some data or work by turning off the computer immediately, leaving 
the computer on might make your computer unusable.
4.  Wait until you are certain that all the liquid is dry before turning on your computer.

Chapter 9. Replacing devices
This chapter provides instructions on how to install or replace hardware for your computer.
Customer Replaceable Units
Customer Replaceable Units (CRUs) are parts that can be upgraded or replaced by the customer. ThinkPad 
computers contain the following types of CRUs: 
•  Self-service CRUs: Refer to parts that can be installed or replaced easily by customer themselves or by 
trained service technicians at an additional cost.
•  Optional-service CRUs: Refer to parts that can be installed or replaced by customers with a greater skill 
level. Trained service technicians can also provide service to install or replace the parts under the type of 
warranty designated for the customer’s machine.
If you intend on installing the CRU, Lenovo will ship the CRU to you. CRU information and replacement 
instructions are shipped with your product and are available from Lenovo at any time upon request. You 
might be required to return the defective part that is replaced by the CRU. When return is required: (1) return 
instructions, a prepaid shipping label, and a container will be included with the replacement CRU; and (2) you 
might be charged for the replacement CRU if Lenovo does not receive the defective CRU within thirty (30) 
days of your receipt of the replacement CRU. See your Lenovo Limited Warranty documentation at 
https:// 
www.lenovo.com/warranty/llw_02
for full details.
For the CRU information of your computer, refer to the following list.
Self-service CRUs
•  ac power adapter and power cord
•  Bottom cover
•  Coin-cell battery
•  Memory modules
•  Speaker assembly
•  M.2 solid-state drives
•  Wireless LAN card

Static electricity prevention
Static electricity, although harmless to you, can seriously damage computer components and options. 
Improper handling of static-sensitive parts can cause damage to the part. When you unpack an option or a 
Customer Replaceable Unit (CRU), do not open the static-protective package until the instructions direct you 
to install the part.
When you handle options or CRUs, or perform any work inside the computer, take the following precautions 
to avoid static-electricity damage: 
•  Limit your movement. Movement can cause static electricity to build up around you.
•  Always handle components carefully. Handle adapters, memory modules, and other circuit boards by the 
edges. Never touch exposed circuitry.
•  Prevent others from touching the components.
