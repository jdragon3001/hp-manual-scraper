Safety lnstructions
Use the following safety guidelines to help protect yourself and your 
computer.
When Using Your Computer 
■ Do not attempt to service the computer yourself. Always follow 
installation instructions closely.
■ Do not carry a battery in your pocket, purse, or other container where 
metal objects (such as car keys) could short-circuit the battery 
terminals. The resulting excessive current follow can cause extremely 
high temperatures and may result in damage from burns.
Do not operate your portable computer for an extended period of time with 
the base resting directly on your body. With extended operation, heat can 
potentially build up in the base. Allowing sustained contact with the skin 
could cause discomfort or, eventually, a burn.

General Precautions
TOSHIBA computers are designed to optimize safety, minimize strain and 
withstand the rigors of portability. However, certain precautions should be 
observed to further reduce the risk of personal injury or damage to the 
computer.
Be certain to read the general precautions below and to note the cautions 
included in the text of the manual.
Creating a computer-friendly environment
Place the computer on a flat surface that is large enough for the computer 
and any other items you are using, such as a printer.
Leave enough space around the computer and other equipment to provide 
adequate ventilation. Otherwise, they may overheat.
To keep your computer in prime operating condition, protect your work area 
from:
■ Dust, moisture, and direct sunlight.
■ Equipment that generates a strong electromagnetic field, such as 
stereo speakers (other than speakers that are connected to the 
computer) or speakerphones.
■ Rapid changes in temperature or humidity and sources of temperature 
change such as air conditioner vents or heaters.
■ Extreme heat, cold, or humidity.
■ Liquids and corrosive chemicals.
Stress injury
Carefully read the Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort. It contains 
information on the prevention of stress injuries to your hands and wrists 
that can be caused by extensive keyboard use. Chapter 3, Getting Started, 
also includes information on work space design, posture and lighting that 
can help reduce physical stress.

--- Page 18 ---
User’s Manual xviii
P300/P300D Series
Heat injury
■ Avoid prolonged physical contact with the computer. If the computer is 
used for long periods, its surface can become very warm. While the 
temperature will not feel hot to the touch, if you maintain physical 
contact with the computer for a long time, for example if you rest the 
computer on your lap or if you keep your hands on the palm rest, your 
skin might suffer a low-heat injury.
■ If the computer has been used for a long time, avoid direct contact with 
the metal plate supporting the various interface ports as this can 
become hot.
■ The surface of the AC adaptor can become hot when in use but this 
condition does not indicate a malfunction. If you need to transport the 
AC adaptor, you should disconnect it and let it cool before moving it.
■ Do not lay the AC adaptor on a material that is sensitive to heat as the 
material could become damaged.
Pressure or impact damage
Do not apply heavy pressure to the computer or subject it to any form of 
strong impact as this can damage the computer's components or otherwise 
cause it to malfunction.
ExpressCard overheating
Some PC and ExpressCards can become hot during prolonged use which 
may result in errors or instability in the operation of the device in question. 
In addition, you should also be careful when you remove a PC or 
ExpressCard that has been used for a long time.
Mobile phones
Please be aware that the use of mobile phones can interfere with the audio 
system. The operation of the computer will not be impaired in any way, but 
it is recommended that a minimum distance of 30cm is maintained between 
the computer and a mobile phone that is in use.
Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort
All important information on the safe and proper use of this computer is 
described in the enclosed Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort. Be 
sure to read it before using the computer.

Key operation
Some operations require you to simultaneously use two or more keys. We 
identify such operations by the key top symbols separated by a plus sign 
(+). For example, Ctrl + C means you must hold down Ctrl and at the same 
time press C. If three keys are used, hold down the first two and at the 
same time press the third.

Introduction
Memory
Slots PC2-5300 (PM965/GM965/RS690M)/PC2-4200 
(GL960) 512 MB, 1024 MB or 2048 MB. Up to 
2 GB memory module can be installed in the 
memory slot for a maximum of 4 GB 
(PM965/GM965/M690G), 2 GB (GL960) system 
memory total, depending on the model you 
purchased.
Main Memory 
Disclaimer
Part of the main system memory may be used by 
the graphics system for graphics performance 
and therefore reduce the amount of main system 
memory available for other computing activities. 
The amount of main system memory allocated to 
support graphics may vary depending on the 
graphics system, applications utilized, system 
memory size and other factors. For PC's 
configured with 4 GB of system memory, the full 
system memory space for computing activities will 
be considerably less and will vary by model and 
system configuration.
If your computer is configured with two 2 GB memory modules, the 
memory might be displayed as approximately 3 GB only (depending on the 
computer's hardware specifications). 
This is correct because the operating system usually displays the available 
memory instead of the physical memory (RAM) built into the computer. 
Various system components (like the video adapter's GPU and PCI 
devices like Wireless LAN, etc.) require their own memory space. Since a 
32-bit operating system cannot address more than 4 GB of memory these 
system resources overlap the physical memory. It is a technical limitation 
that the overlapped memory is not available to the operating system. 
Even though some tools might display the actual physical memory built 
into your computer, the memory available to the operating system will still 
be approximately 3 GB only.

RTC Battery  The internal RTC battery backs up the Real Time 
Clock and calendar. 
AC Adaptor  The universal AC adaptor provides power to the 
system and recharges the batteries when they 
are low. It comes with a detachable power cord. 
Because it is universal, it can receive a range of 
AC voltage from 100 to 240 volts; however, the 
output current varies among different models. 
Using the wrong model can damage your 
computer. Refer to the AC adaptor section in 
Chapter 2, The Grand Tour.
