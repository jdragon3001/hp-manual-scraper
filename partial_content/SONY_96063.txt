What is Bluetooth™ wireless technology?
Bluetooth™ wireless technology is a global standard telecommunications format that enables data to be exchanged wirelessly between personal
computers, peripheral components, mobile telephones, and other electronic devices.
Registering devices having onboard Bluetooth™ wireless technology to let them communicate with one another will make it possible for data to be
readily exchanged between the devices. 
A maximum of seven Bluetooth™ wireless technology devices may be connected together. By using Bluetooth™ wireless technology to connect
to a mouse, keyboard, modem, printer, or other device, you can do away with messy cabling and avoid any concerns about space restrictions,
which will allow you to work more comfortably.

What you need to know about using Bluetooth™™ wireless technology
Bluetooth™ wireless technology exchanges data using radio waves.
The following points are critical in order for Bluetooth devices to be configured and used correctly. 

The devices must be Bluetooth™ wireless technology-compatible

The devices must be close enough to be able to communicate

The devices must be in a connectable state

No other radio wave-emitting devices should be operated nearby

The Bluetooth devices must be switched ON
The devices must be Bluetooth™ wireless technology-compatible
The hardware and software used in your PC and other devices must be Bluetooth™ wireless technology compatible.
Bluetooth™ wireless technology compatible products normally bear the following logo:
For further details, please refer to your local retailer or consult the product instruction manual. 
Note

A Bluetooth™ wireless technology communication card, adapter, or other similar device (sold separately) needs to be installed in PCs or
PDAs (personal digital assistants) that do not have onboard Bluetooth™ wireless technology.
The Bluetooth™ wireless technology devices must be able to communicate with each other
Devices situated in locations beyond the reach of the radio waves will not recognize each other, which will make communication impossible.
In particular, please ensure that your devices are located close enough so that they can communicate with each other before you initially register
and configure them. 
Note

PCs have a communication distance restriction of ten meters. Please refer to the instruction manuals for information on the communication
distance restrictions specific to each device.

Communication interference may occur if any obstructions are located between the devices. Devices may not communicate properly if they
have been located, for example, on the ground and first floors of a residence, despite their being within the acceptable distance. 
The devices must be in a connectable state
The devices must recognize each other in order to be connectable for use.
In certain devices, simply turning on the power will not produce a connectable state. Moreover, the energy-saving feature may come into effect
after a certain amount of time, which will prevent the devices from being detected. Please refer to the specific product instruction manual for further
details. 
No other radio wave-emitting devices should be operated nearby
Microwave ovens, wireless LANs, and other radio wave-emitting devices located nearby may affect Bluetooth™ wireless technology
communication.

Please ensure that your devices have been accordingly situated, and that the above devices are not in use when you are operating your Bluetooth
device.
The Bluetooth™ wireless technology devices must be switched ON
Bluetooth™ wireless technology cannot be used if the devices have not been switched ON.
Some PCs and other components will have a Bluetooth™ wireless technology communication switch that is operated independently from the main
power. Bluetooth™ wireless technology cannot function if this switch has been turned off.

Varieties of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices you can use
It is important to understand the concepts of "services" and "profiles" in order to determine whether an intended function can be properly utilized
when you use a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology device. 
What is a "profile"?
Examples of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices include mice and keyboards (input devices), printers (output devices), and wireless modems
(communication devices). Functions that can be utilized by such devices are called "services." 
In order for these services to be used reliably, Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices are provided with common specifications known as
"profiles."
For example, when a PC makes a connection to a device, it obtains the profile of the corresponding device and thereby ascertains which functions
(services) the device offers. 
As an example, imagine someone who travels overseas. 
The traveller is only able to converse properly with their counterpart if both speak a language (English, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) they both
understand.
However, no dialogue will occur if they do not share a common language.
In the above example, the traveller and his/her counterpart correspond to the devices, the languages to the profiles, and the dialogues between the
two people to the services. The former example refers to a situation where a service can be performed because the devices support a common
profile, whereas the latter example refers to a situation where a service cannot be performed because a common profile is not supported. 
In other words, you will be able to use Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices that have a profile supported by a PC (the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility in
this case).
If the profiles belonging to the device are not supported by the PC, the functions corresponding to those profiles will not be able to be utilized.
Also, a device can only be used if its profiles are supported by the PC. 
Types of profiles
The following profiles are supported by the Bluetooth
TM

Building a personal area network
  [PAN]
You can use the PAN profile to build a network of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-enabled devices.
→Operating as a server
→Operating as a client
A personal area network comprises a client-server architecture. The device to which other devices connect is called the "server", and a device that
connects to the server is called a "client."
The client-server relationship is not necessarily a fixed one. The first of two devices to establish a connection can be the server when one other
device is present, and can be the client in other instances.
Note

The maximum total number of devices that can be used to constitute a single personal area network is seven: one server and six clients.
A network comprising as many as seven devices could theoretically be built, but an operating environment that involves the use of other
Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices, leaving aside other complications, might require the network to comprise fewer components..
By using the PAN profile, you will be able to build a network that uses the same TCP/IP protocol used in regular LANs. Accordingly, the machine
designated as the server can be used for configuration tasks that utilize DHCP, such as assigning IP addresses to clients.
In addition, you will be able to configure folder and file sharing, which will allow data to be browsed by other servers or clients on the network.
　　　　
Page 61

--- Page 62 ---
Important

Please refer to Windows Help for further information on TCP/IP, DHCP and configurations for sharing.
Operating as a server
The following icon will appear in the tasktray when the PAN server function has been activated.
Should the icon not appear, please follow the procedure below to activate the PAN server function.
1. Right-click the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray and make sure the [service property] of Option [Use PAN
Group Ad-hoc Network] is checked. 
A message will appear asking you to confirm whether you wish to activate the PAN group ad-hoc network. 
2. Click the [Yes] button 
The PAN server will be activated, and an icon will accordingly appear in the tasktray. Other devices that use the PAN profile will now
be able to connect over the network. 
Important

When using the device as the server, make sure that all user accounts have a password set for the security reasons. 

The IP address of the server is automatically set up when it starts. Please do not change this IP address. 

When the device starts as the server, it starts the DHCP server function. We recommend that you should use the IP addresses provided
from this DHCP server for the clients connected. Please do not change these IP addresses. 
By clicking on the icon, the [Bluetooth PAN Server] window will appear. 
In the graphic below, one client has established a connection.
Page 62

--- Page 63 ---
Note

When you try to connect to another server as a client, the task tray icon will disappear, and your machine will not be able to function as a
server in response to connection requests originating from other devices.

During server starting, it is not possible to stop the DHCP server. 
Operating as a client
Connecting to a server as a client is performed from the [Bluetooth Settings] window, as described below.
Procedure
1. Right-click on the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray, and click on [Add New Connection]

Building a personal area network
  [PAN]
You can use the PAN profile to build a network of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-enabled devices.
→Operating as a server
→Operating as a client
A personal area network comprises a client-server architecture. The device to which other devices connect is called the "server", and a device that
connects to the server is called a "client."
The client-server relationship is not necessarily a fixed one. The first of two devices to establish a connection can be the server when one other
device is present, and can be the client in other instances.
Note

The maximum total number of devices that can be used to constitute a single personal area network is seven: one server and six clients.
A network comprising as many as seven devices could theoretically be built, but an operating environment that involves the use of other
Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices, leaving aside other complications, might require the network to comprise fewer components..
By using the PAN profile, you will be able to build a network that uses the same TCP/IP protocol used in regular LANs. Accordingly, the machine
designated as the server can be used for configuration tasks that utilize DHCP, such as assigning IP addresses to clients.
In addition, you will be able to configure folder and file sharing, which will allow data to be browsed by other servers or clients on the network.
　　　　
Page 295

--- Page 296 ---
Important

Please refer to Windows Help for further information on TCP/IP, DHCP and configurations for sharing.
Operating as a server
The following icon will appear in the tasktray when the PAN server function has been activated.
Should the icon not appear, please follow the procedure below to activate the PAN server function.
1. Right-click the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray and make sure the [service property] of Option [Use PAN
Group Ad-hoc Network] is checked. 
A message will appear asking you to confirm whether you wish to activate the PAN group ad-hoc network. 
2. Click the [Yes] button 
The PAN server will be activated, and an icon will accordingly appear in the tasktray. Other devices that use the PAN profile will now
be able to connect over the network. 
Important

When using the device as the server, make sure that all user accounts have a password set for the security reasons. 

The IP address of the server is automatically set up when it starts. Please do not change this IP address. 

When the device starts as the server, it starts the DHCP server function. We recommend that you should use the IP addresses provided
from this DHCP server for the clients connected. Please do not change these IP addresses. 
By clicking on the icon, the [Bluetooth PAN Server] window will appear. 
In the graphic below, one client has established a connection.
Page 296

--- Page 297 ---
Note

When you try to connect to another server as a client, the task tray icon will disappear, and your machine will not be able to function as a
server in response to connection requests originating from other devices.

During server starting, it is not possible to stop the DHCP server. 
Operating as a client
Connecting to a server as a client is performed from the [Bluetooth Settings] window, as described below.

Manually creating a virtual Bluetooth COM port
In order for a PC to connect to and communicate with a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology device, the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility will create a gateway for
data to be exchanged between the respective devices. This gateway is known as a "port" (or "virtual COM port").
Since one virtual COM port will be allocated to each device, trouble-free communication will still be possible even if several devices are being used.
When you use the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility, a virtual COM port will be automatically created on set-up; however, virtual COM ports can be created
manually if so needed. 
Note

Bluetooth Manager must be active in order for you to be able to use Bluetooth Local COM.
Clients and servers
When Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology communications are performed, there will always be a "client/server" relationship between the various
devices. A "client" is a device that sends certain requests to another device, while a "server" is a device that provides a service on receipt of such
requests from another device. 
For example, when a PC issues a print command to a wireless printer, the PC functions as the client, while the printer functions as the server.
When a PDA or other device attempts to receive files located on a PC by means of file transfer protocol, the PC functions as the server, while the
PDA functions as the client.
Virtual Bluetooth COM ports can be created both for clients and servers. 

Bluetooth virtual COM port for a client
Virtual COM port used when your device is the client, and requests are sent to another device.

Bluetooth virtual COM port for a server
Virtual COM port used when your device is the server, and requests are received from another device.
Creating a virtual COM port
Bluetooth virtual COM ports are created according to the procedure below.
Procedure
1. Click on the [Printers and Other Hardware] icon in the Control Panel
The [Printers and Other Hardware] window appears.
2. Double-click on the [Bluetooth Local COM] icon
Page 358

--- Page 359 ---
The main Bluetooth Local COM window will appear.
Note
o
Even when the Control Panel appears in Classic view, please simply click on the [Bluetooth Local COM] icon.
o
No such distinction between viewing formats exists in Windows 2000.
3. Click on the [Add...] button
The [Bluetooth Local COM Wizard] window, from where you can create a virtual COM port, will appear.
Page 359

--- Page 360 ---
Start from this window when creating Bluetooth virtual COM ports for either servers or clients.
→Creating a Bluetooth virtual COM port for a client
→Creating a Bluetooth virtual COM port for a server
Deleting a virtual COM port
Please follow the procedure below to delete a virtual COM port when it is no longer needed.
Note

You can only delete virtual COM ports created by the Bluetooth Local COM utility.
1. Select the port you wish to delete from the [Bluetooth Local COM] window, and then click on the [Delete] button
A message will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the port.
2. Click on the [Yes] button
The port will be deleted.

Building a personal area network
  [PAN]
You can use the PAN profile to build a network of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-enabled devices.
→Operating as a server
→Operating as a client
A personal area network comprises a client-server architecture. The device to which other devices connect is called the "server", and a device that
connects to the server is called a "client."
The client-server relationship is not necessarily a fixed one. The first of two devices to establish a connection can be the server when one other
device is present, and can be the client in other instances.
Note

The maximum total number of devices that can be used to constitute a single personal area network is seven: one server and six clients.
A network comprising as many as seven devices could theoretically be built, but an operating environment that involves the use of other
Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices, leaving aside other complications, might require the network to comprise fewer components..
By using the PAN profile, you will be able to build a network that uses the same TCP/IP protocol used in regular LANs. Accordingly, the machine
designated as the server can be used for configuration tasks that utilize DHCP, such as assigning IP addresses to clients.
In addition, you will be able to configure folder and file sharing, which will allow data to be browsed by other servers or clients on the network.
　　　　
Page 434

--- Page 435 ---
Important

Please refer to Windows Help for further information on TCP/IP, DHCP and configurations for sharing.
Operating as a server
The following icon will appear in the tasktray when the PAN server function has been activated.
Should the icon not appear, please follow the procedure below to activate the PAN server function.
1. Right-click the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray and make sure the [service property] of Option [Use PAN
Group Ad-hoc Network] is checked. 
A message will appear asking you to confirm whether you wish to activate the PAN group ad-hoc network. 
2. Click the [Yes] button 
The PAN server will be activated, and an icon will accordingly appear in the tasktray. Other devices that use the PAN profile will now
be able to connect over the network. 
Important

When using the device as the server, make sure that all user accounts have a password set for the security reasons. 

The IP address of the server is automatically set up when it starts. Please do not change this IP address. 

When the device starts as the server, it starts the DHCP server function. We recommend that you should use the IP addresses provided
from this DHCP server for the clients connected. Please do not change these IP addresses. 
By clicking on the icon, the [Bluetooth PAN Server] window will appear. 
In the graphic below, one client has established a connection.
Page 435

--- Page 436 ---
Note

When you try to connect to another server as a client, the task tray icon will disappear, and your machine will not be able to function as a
server in response to connection requests originating from other devices.

During server starting, it is not possible to stop the DHCP server. 
Operating as a client
Connecting to a server as a client is performed from the [Bluetooth Settings] window, as described below.
Procedure
1. Right-click on the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray, and click on [Add New Connection]
