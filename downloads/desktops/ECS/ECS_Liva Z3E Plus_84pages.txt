Using BIOS
About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc. ” BIOS
with support for Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on the
motherboard contains the ROM setup instructions for configuring
the motherboard BIOS.
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays the
system’s configuration status and provides you with options to set
system parameters. The parameters are stored in battery-backed-
up CMOS RAM that saves this information when the power is turned
off. When the system is turned back on, the system is configured
with the values you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer
performs. Before using the Setup Utility, ensure that you understand
the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.
• Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
• Video display type and display options
• Password protection from unauthorized use
• Power Management features

The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility.
However, we recommend that you read this chapter in case you need
to make any changes in the future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
• when changing the system configuration
• when a configuration error is detected and you are
prompted to make changes to the Setup Utility
• when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
• when making changes to the Power Management
configuration
• when changing the password or making other changes
to the Security Setup
Press DEL to enter SETUP
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On Self Test
(POST) routines. POST is a series of built-in diagnostics performed
by the BIOS. After the POST routines are completed, the following
message appears:
Press the delete key to access BIOS Setup Utility.

Resetting the Default CMOS Values
When powering on for the first time, the POST screen may show a
“CMOS Settings Wrong” message. This standard message will appear
following a clear CMOS data at factory by the manufacturer. You
simply need to Load Default Settings and Save it to reset the default
CMOS values.
Note: Changes to system hardware such as different CPU, memories,
etc. may also trigger this message.

Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this motherboard
from the manufacturer’s Website. New BIOS provides support for
new peripherals, improvements in performance, or fixes for known
bugs. Install new BIOS as follows:
1 If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper,
change the setting to allow BIOS flashing.
2 If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write
Protect in Advanced BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware
Write Protect prevents BIOS from being overwritten.)
3 Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system
disk. (Refer to Windows online help for information on
creating a bootable system disk.)
4 Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the
manufacturer’s Web site. Copy these files to the
bootable device.
5 Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device
in your computer. (You might need to run the Setup
Utility and change the boot priority items on the
Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force your
computer to boot from the bootable device first.)
6 At the C:\ or A:\ prompt, type the Flash Utility program
name and the file name of the new BIOS and then press
<Enter>. Example: AFUDOS.EXE 040706.ROM
7 When the installation is complete, remove the bootable
device from the computer and restart your computer. If
your motherboard has a Flash BIOS jumper, reset the
jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from being
overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.

1. Install Windows OS via Windows official DVD.
2. Install Windows OS via USB flash drive.

and then copies the contents of the Windows 10 installation ISO
file to the flash drive.

Windows 10 installing process.
You need to change the booting priority in BIOS in order to
boot from USB device. Enter into BIOS and select the Boot

booting priority.

If the auto-install DVD-ROM does not work on your system, you
can still install drivers through the file manager for your OS (for
example, Windows Explorer). Look for the chipset and motherboard
model, and then browse to the directory and path to begin
installing the drivers. Most drivers have a setup program (SETUP.EXE)
that automatically detects your operating system before installation.
Other drivers have the setup program located in the operating
system subfolder.
Manual Installation
If the driver you want to install does not have a setup program,
browse to the operating system subfolder and locate the readme
text file (README.TXT or README.DOC) for information on
installing the driver or software for your operating system.
