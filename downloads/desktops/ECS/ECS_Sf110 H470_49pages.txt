Using BIOS
About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc. ” BIOS with support for
Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on the motherboard contains the ROM
setup instructions for configuring the motherboard BIOS.
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays the system’s
configuration status and provides you with options to set system parameters. The
parameters are stored in battery-backed-up CMOS RAM that saves this information
when the power is turned off. When the system is turned back on, the system is
configured with the values you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
• Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
• Video display type and display options
• Password protection from unauthorized use
• Power Management features
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer performs. Before
using the Setup Utility, ensure that you understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.
The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility. However, we
recommend that you read this chapter in case you need to make any changes in the
future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
• when changing the system configuration
• when a configuration error is detected and you are prompted to make
changes to the Setup Utility
• when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
• when making changes to the Power Management configuration
• when changing the password or making other changes to the Security
Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On Self Test (POST)
routines. POST is a series of built-in diagnostics performed by the BIOS. After the
POST routines are completed, the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP

<Enter>.
Some options lead to pop-up dialog boxes that prompt you to verify that you wish to
execute that option. Other options lead to dialog boxes that prompt you for
information.
Press the delete key to access BIOS Setup Utility.
Resetting the Default CMOS Values
When powering on for the first time, the POST screen may show a “CMOS Settings
Wrong” message. This standard message will appear following a clear CMOS data at
factory by the manufacturer. You simply need to Load Default Settings to reset the
default CMOS values.
Note: Changes to system hardware such as different CPU, memories, etc. may also
trigger this message.

Using BIOS
Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this motherboard from the
manufacturer’s Web site. New BIOS provides support for new peripherals,
improvements in performance, or fixes for known bugs. Install new BIOS as follows:
1 If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, change the setting to
allow BIOS flashing.
2 If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write Protect in
Advanced BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware Write Protect prevents
BIOS from being overwritten.)
3 Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system disk. (Refer to
Windows online help for information on creating a bootable system
disk.)
4 Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the manufacturer’s
Web site. Copy these files to the bootable device.
5 Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device in your
computer. (You might need to run the Setup Utility and change the boot
priority items on the Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force
your computer to boot from the bootable device first.)
6 At the C:\ or A:\ prompt, type the Flash Utility program name and the file
name of the new BIOS and then press <Enter>. Example: AFUDOS.EXE
040706.ROM
7 When the installation is complete, remove the bootable device from the
computer and restart your computer. If your motherboard has a Flash
BIOS jumper, reset the jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from
being overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.

Using the Software
If the auto-install DVD-ROM does not work on your system, you can still install
drivers through the file manager for your OS (for example, Windows Explorer). 
Look
for the chipset and motherboard model, and then browse to the directory and path
to begin installing the drivers. Most drivers have a setup program (SETUP.EXE) that
automatically detects your operating system before installation. Other drivers have
the setup program located in the operating system subfolder.
Manual Installation
ECS Utility Software (Intelligent EZ Utility)
ECS Intelligent EZ Utility provides friendly interfaces under Windows O.S, which makes
your computing more easily and conveniently.
If the driver you want to install does not have a setup program, browse to the
operating system subfolder and locate the readme text file (README.TXT or
README.DOC) for information on installing the driver or software for your operating
system.
These software(s) are subject to change at anytime without prior notice. Please
refer to the support disk for available software.

Chapter 5
Trouble Shooting
Start up problems during assembly
After assembling the PC for the first time you may experience some start up
problems. Before calling for technical support or returning for warranty, this chapter
may help to address some of the common questions using some basic troubleshooting
tips.
a) System does not power up and the fans are not running.
1.Disassemble the PC to remove the VGA adaptor card, DDR memory, LAN, USB
and other peripherals including keyboard and mouse. Leave only the motherboard,
CPU with CPU cooler and power supply connected. Turn on again to see if the
CPU and power supply fans are running.
2. Make sure to remove any unused screws or other metal objects such as screwdrivers
from the inside PC case. This is to prevent damage from short circuit.
3. Check the CPU FAN connector is connected to the motherboard.
4. For Intel platforms check the pins on the CPU socket for damage or bent. A bent
pin may cause failure to boot and sometimes permanent damage from short circuit.
5. Check the 19V power connector is connected to the motherboard.
6. Check that the 19V power is fully inserted into the motherboard connectors.
Make sure the latches of the cable and connector are locked into place.
b) Power is on,   fans are running but there is no display
1. Make sure the monitor is turned on and the monitor cable is properly connected
to the PC.
2. Check the VGA adapter card (if applicable) is inserted properly.
3. Listen for beep sounds. If you are using internal PC speaker make sure it is
connected.
   a. continuous 3 short beeps :  memory not detected
   b. 1 long beep and 8 short beeps : VGA not detected

--- Page 47 ---

Trouble Shooting
c) The PC suddenly shuts down while booting up.
1. The CPU may experience overheating so it will shutdown to protect itself.
Ensure the CPU fan is working properly.
2. From the BIOS setting, try to disable the Smartfan function to let the fan run at
default speed. Doing a Load Optimised Default will also disable the Smartfan.
Your computer, like any electrical appliance, requires proper care and maintenance.
Here are some basic PC care tips to help prolong the life of the motherboard and
keep it running as best as it can.
1. Keep your computer in a well ventilated area. Leave some space between
   the PC and the wall for sufficient airflow.
2. Keep your computer in a cool dry place. Avoid dusty areas, direct sunlight
Start up problems after prolong use
After a prolong period of use your PC may experience start up problems again.
This may be caused by breakdown of devices connected to the motherboard such as
HDD, CPU fan, etc. The following tips may help to revive the PC or identify the
cause of failure.
1. Clear the CMOS values using the CLR_CMOS jumper. Refer to CLR_CMOS
jumper in Chapter 2 for Checking Jumper Settings in this user manual. When
completed, follow up with a Load Optimised Default in the BIOS setup.
2. Check the system fan for dust. Long term accumulation of dust will reduce its
effectiveness to cool the processor. Clean the cooler or replace a new one if
necessary.
3. Remove the hard drive or DDR memory to determine which of these component
may be at fault.
Maintenance and care tips
   and areas of high moisture content.
3. Routinely clean the CPU cooler fan to remove dust and hair.
4. In places of hot and humid weather you should turn on your computer once
   every other week to circulate the air and prevent damage from humidity.
5. Add more memory to your computer if possible. This not only speeds up the
   system but also reduces the loading of your hard drive to prolong its life span.
6. If possible, ensure the power cord has an earth ground pin directly from the
   wall outlet. This will reduce voltage fluctuation that may damage sensitive devices.
