2.6 Checking Jumper Settings
This section explains how to set jumpers for correct configuration of the motherboard.
Setting Jumpers
Use the motherboard jumpers to set system configuration options. Jumpers with
more than one pin are numbered. When setting the jumpers, ensure that the jumper
caps are placed on the correct pins.
The illustrations show a 2-pin jumper. When
the jumper cap is placed on both pins, the
jumper is SHORT. If you remove the jumper
cap, or place the jumper cap on just one pin,
the jumper is OPEN.
This illustration shows a 3-pin jumper. Pins
1 and 2 are SHORT.
  SHORT                  OPEN

Using BIOS
About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc. ” BIOS with support for
Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on the motherboard contains the ROM
setup instructions for configuring the motherboard BIOS.
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays the system’s
configuration status and provides you with options to set system parameters. The
parameters are stored in battery-backed-up CMOS RAM that saves this information
when the power is turned off. When the system is turned back on, the system is
configured with the values you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
• Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
• Video display type and display options
• Password protection from unauthorized use
• Power Management features
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer performs. Before
using the Setup Utility, ensure that you understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.
The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility. However, we
recommend that you read this chapter in case you need to make any changes in the
future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
• when changing the system configuration
• when a configuration error is detected and you are prompted to make
changes to the Setup Utility
• when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
• when making changes to the Power Management configuration
• when changing the password or making other changes to the Security
Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On Self Test (POST)
routines. POST is a series of built-in diagnostics performed by the BIOS. After the
POST routines are completed, the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP
Chapter 3
Using BIOS

Using BIOS
Press the delete key to access BIOS Setup Utility.
Using BIOS
When you start the Setup Utility, the main menu appears. The main menu of the
Setup Utility displays a list of the options that are available. A highlight indicates
which option is currently selected. Use the cursor arrow keys to move the highlight
to other options. When an option is highlighted, execute the option by pressing
<Enter>.
Some options lead to pop-up dialog boxes that prompt you to verify that you wish to
execute that option. Other options lead to dialog boxes that prompt you for
information.
Some options (marked with a triangle  ) lead to submenus that enable you to change
the values for the option. Use the cursor arrow keys to scroll through the items in the
submenu.
Resetting the Default CMOS Values
When powering on for the first time, the POST screen may show a “CMOS
Settings Wrong” message. This standard message will appear following a clear
CMOS data at factory by the manufacturer. You simply need to Load Default
Settings to reset the default CMOS values.
 
Note: Changes to system hardware such as different CPU, memories, etc. may also
trigger this message.

Using BIOS
Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this motherboard from the
manufacturer’s Web site. New BIOS provides support for new peripherals,
improvements in performance, or fixes for known bugs. Install new BIOS as follows:
This concludes Chapter 3. Refer to the next chapter for information on the software
supplied with the motherboard.
1 If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, change the setting to
allow BIOS flashing.
2 If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write Protect in
Advanced BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware Write Protect prevents
BIOS from being overwritten.)
3 Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system disk. (Refer to
Windows online help for information on creating a bootable system disk.)
4 Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the manufacturer’s
Web site. Copy these files to the bootable device.
5 Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device in your computer.
(You might need to run the Setup Utility and change the boot priority
items on the Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force your computer
to boot from the bootable device first.)
6 At the C:\ or A:\ prompt, type the Flash Utility program name and the file
name of the new BIOS and then press <Enter>. Example: AFUDOS.EXE
040706.ROM
7 When the installation is complete, remove the bootable device from the
computer and restart your computer. If your motherboard has a Flash
BIOS jumper, reset the jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from
being overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.
Note: After flashing BIOS, recommend to shutdown system and remove
AC power cord over 10 seconds to ensure that system is at G3 state. Then
plug back the power cord, power on system and press <Del> to enter
BIOS setup menu. Select [Load default setting], then [Save & Exit Setup].

If the auto-install DVD-ROM does not work on your system, you can still install
drivers through the file manager for your OS (for example, Windows Explorer).
Look for the chipset and motherboard model, and then browse to the directory and
path to begin installing the drivers. Most drivers have a setup program (SETUP.EXE)
that automatically detects your operating system before installation. Other drivers
have the setup program located in the operating system subfolder.
Manual Installation
If the driver you want to install does not have a setup program, browse to the
operating system subfolder and locate the readme text file (README.TXT or
README.DOC) for information on installing the driver or software for your
operating system.
Windows 8 will appear below UAC (User Account Control) message after
the system restart. You must select “Yes” to install the next driver.
Continue this process to complete the drivers installation.

Maintenance and care tips
Your computer, like any electrical appliance, requires proper care and maintenance.
Here are some basic PC care tips to help prolong the life of the motherboard and
keep it running as best as it can.
1. Keep your computer in a well ventilated area. Leave some space between the PC
and the wall for sufficient airflow.
2. Keep your computer in a cool dry place. Avoid dusty areas, direct sunlight and
areas of high moisture content.
3. In places of hot and humid weather you should turn on your computer once
every other week to circulate the air and prevent damage from humidity.
4. If possible, ensure the power cord has an earth ground pin directly from the wall
outlet. This will reduce voltage fluctuation that may damage sensitive devices.
Panel clean tips
The following steps explains how to clean the panel:
1. When cleaning the computer, please make sure that the computer is switched
off.
2. Put on gloves to prevent stains on the touch panel and prevent injured by the
sharp edge of the touch panel.
3. Do not hold FPC/Copper tail while handing the touch panel.
4. Do not pile up touch panel and put heavy matter on touch panel.
5. Do not add any stress on touch film.
6. Use dry cloth or soft cloth with alcohol, neutral detergent or ethanol for clearing
the touch panel in case of dirt on it.
