Using BIOS
About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc.” BIOS with support for 
Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on the motherboard contains the ROM setup 
instructions for configuring the motherboard BIOS. 
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays the system’s 
configuration status and provides you with options to set system parameters. The 
parameters are stored in battery-backed-up CMOS RAM that saves this information 
when the power is turned off. When the system is turned back on, the system is 
configured with the values you stored in CMOS.  
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
•  Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
•  Video display type and display options
•  Password protection from unauthorized use
•  Power Management features
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer performs. Before using 
the Setup Utility, ensure that you understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.
The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility. However, we   
recommend that you read this chapter in case you need to make any changes in the 
future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
•  when changing the system configuration
•  when a configuration error is detected and you are prompted to make 
changes to the Setup Utility
•  when making changes to the Power Management configuration
•  when changing the password or making other changes to the Security Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On Self Test (POST) routines. 
POST is a series of built-in diagnostics performed by the BIOS. After the POST routines 
are completed, the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP

SF110 B660 USER MANUAL
Using BIOS
When you start the Setup Utility, the main menu appears. The main menu of the 
Setup Utility displays a list of the options that are available. A highlight indicates which 
option is currently selected. Use the cursor arrow keys to move the highlight to other 
options. When an option is highlighted, execute the option by pressing <Enter>. 
Some options lead to pop-up dialog boxes that prompt you to verify that you wish 
to execute that option. Other options lead to dialog boxes that prompt you for          
information. 
Some options (marked with an icon   ) lead to submenus that enable you to change 
the values for the option. Use the cursor arrow keys to scroll through the items in the 
submenu.
In this manual, default values are enclosed in parenthesis. Submenu items are denoted 
by an icon 
 
.
The default BIOS setting for this motherboard apply for most conditions 
with optimum performance. We do not suggest users change the default 
values in the BIOS setup and take no responsibility to any damage caused 
by changing the BIOS settings.

Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this motherboard from the manufacturer’s 
Website. New BIOS provides support for new peripherals, improvements in 
performance, or fixes for known bugs. Install new BIOS as follows:
1  If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, change the setting to 
allow BIOS flashing.
2  If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write Protect in Advanced 
BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware Write Protect prevents BIOS from being 
overwritten.)
3  Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system disk. (Refer to 
Windows online help for information on creating a bootable system disk.)
4  Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the manufacturer’s Web 
site. Copy these files to the bootable device.
5  Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device in your computer. 
(You might need to run the Setup Utility and change the boot priority items 
on the Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force your computer to boot 
from the bootable device first.)
6  At the fs0:\> prompt, type the Flash Utility program name and the file name 
of the new BIOS and then press <Enter>. Example: AFUEFIX64.EFI 040706.
ROM
7  When the installation is complete, remove the bootable device from the 
computer and restart your computer. If your motherboard has a Flash BIOS 
jumper, reset the jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from being 
overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.
This concludes Chapter 3. Refer to the next chapter for information on the software 
supplied with the motherboard.

Troubleshooting and problem solution
After assembling the PC for the first time you may experience some start up problems. 
Before calling for technical support or returning for warranty, this chapter may help to 
address some of the common questions using some basic troubleshooting tips.
a)  Boot up failed.
1.  Use the specified adapter provided by ECS
2.  Check whether the adapter has been plugged in. 
3.  Check the connection between adapter and the system.
4.  Check that the power button can be pushed normally. If it is successfully power on, 
the white light from LED will show up.
5.  If the boot up problem still exists after these checking steps, please turn to local 
dealer or repair center for further customer service.
b)  Black screen or no image is displayed on the monitor.
1.  Check whether the monitor has been turned on or works normally on other system.
2.  Check whether the system has been power on successfully.
3.  Check the cable is securely inserted into rear IO ports(VGA/HDMI) and also at 
monitor side (VGA/HDMI).
4.  If the display problem still exists after checking steps, please turn to local dealer or
