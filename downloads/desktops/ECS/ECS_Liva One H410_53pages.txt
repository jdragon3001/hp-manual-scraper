About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc. ” BIOS with support for
Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on the motherboard contains the ROM setup
instructions for configuring the motherboard BIOS.
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays the system’s con-
figuration status and provides you with options to set system parameters. The pa-
rameters are stored in battery-backed-up CMOS RAM that saves this information
when the power is turned off. When the system is turned back on, the system is
configured with the values you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer performs. Before
using the Setup Utility, ensure that you understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.
The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility. However, we rec-
ommend that you read this chapter in case you need to make any changes in the
future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
• when changing the system configuration
• when a configuration error is detected and you are prompted to make
changes to the Setup Utility
• when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
• when making changes to the Power Management configuration
• when changing the password or making other changes to the Security
Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On Self Test (POST) routines.
POST is a series of built-in diagnostics performed by the BIOS. After the POST routines
are completed, the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP
Chapter 3
Using BIOS

--- Page 17 ---

LIVA One H410 USER MANUAL
Press the delete key to access BIOS Setup Utility.
Resetting the Default CMOS Values
When powering on for the first time, the POST screen may show a “CMOS Settings
Wrong” message. This standard message will appear following a clear CMOS data
at factory by the manufacturer. You simply need to Load Default Settings to reset
the default CMOS values.
Note: Changes to system hardware such as different CPU, memories, etc. may
also trigger this message.
Using BIOS
When you start the Setup Utility, the main menu appears. The main menu of the
Setup Utility displays a list of the options that are available. A highlight indicates
which option is currently selected. Use the cursor arrow keys to move the highlight
to other options. When an option is highlighted, execute the option by pressing
<Enter>.
Some options lead to pop-up dialog boxes that prompt you to verify that you wish to
execute that option. Other options lead to dialog boxes that prompt you for
information.
Some options (marked with an icon    ) lead to submenus that enable you to change
the values for the option. Use the cursor arrow keys to scroll through the items in the
submenu.

1 If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, change the setting to
allow BIOS flashing.
2 If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write Protect in
Advanced BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware Write Protect prevents BIOS
from being overwritten.)
3 Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system disk. (Refer to
Windows online help for information on creating a bootable system disk.)
4 Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the manufacturer’s
Web site. Copy these files to the bootable device.
5 Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device in your computer.
(You might need to run the Setup Utility and change the boot priority items
on the Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force your computer to
boot from the bootable device first.)
6 At the fs0:\> prompt, type the Flash Utility program name and the file name
of the new BIOS and then press <Enter>. Example: AFUEFIX64.EFI
040706.ROM
7 When the installation is complete, remove the bootable device from the
computer and restart your computer. If your motherboard has a Flash
BIOS jumper, reset the jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from
being overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.

If the auto-install DVD-ROM does not work on your system, you can still install
drivers through the file manager for your OS (for example, Windows Explorer). 
Look
for the chipset and motherboard model, and then browse to the directory and path
to begin installing the drivers. Most drivers have a setup program (SETUP.EXE) that
automatically detects your operating system before installation. Other drivers have
the setup program located in the operating system subfolder.

README.DOC) for information on installing the driver or software for your operating
system.
These software(s) are subject to change at anytime without prior notice. Please
