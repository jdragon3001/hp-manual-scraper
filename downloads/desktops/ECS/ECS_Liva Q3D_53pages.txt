About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends 
Inc.” BIOS with support for Windows Plug and Play. The 
CMOS chip on the motherboard contains the ROM setup 
instructions for configuring the motherboard BIOS. 
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility 
displays the system’s configuration status and provides you 
with options to set system parameters. The parameters 
are stored in battery-backedup CMOS RAM that saves this 
information when the power is turned off. When the system 
is turned back on, the system is configured with the values 
you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
•  Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
•  Video display type and display options
•  Password protection from unauthorized use
•  Power Management features
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the 
computer performs. Before using the Setup Utility, ensure 
that you understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.

The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup 
Utility. However, we recommend that you read this chapter 
in case you need to make any changes in the future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
•  when changing the system configuration
•  when a configuration error is detected and you are 
prompted to make changes to the Setup Utility
•  when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
•  when making changes to the Power Management 
configuration
•  when changing the password or making other 
changes to the Security Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-
On Self Test (POST) routines. POST is a series of built-in 
diagnostics performed by the BIOS. After the POST routines 
are completed, the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP
Press the delete key to access BIOS Setup Utility.
Resetting the Default CMOS Values
When powering on for the first time, the POST screen may 
show a “CMOS Settings Wrong” message. This standard 
message will appear following a clear CMOS data at factory

by the manufacturer. You simply need to Load Default 
Settings and Save it to reset the default CMOS values.
Note: Changes to system hardware such as different CPU, 
memories, etc. may also trigger this message.
Using BIOS
When you start the Setup Utility, the main menu appears. 
The main menu of the Setup Utility displays a list of the 
options that are available. A highlight indicates which option 
is currently selected. Use the cursor arrow keys to move the 
highlight to other options. When an option is highlighted, 
execute the option by pressing <Enter>.
Some options lead to pop-up dialog boxes that prompt you 
to verify that you wish to execute that option. Other options 
lead to dialog boxes that prompt you for information. 
Some options (marked with a triangle 

) lead to submenus 
that enable you to change the values for the option. Use 
the cursor arrow keys to scroll through the items in the 
submenu.
In this manual, default values are enclosed in parenthesis. 
Submenu items are denoted by a triangle 

.
The default BIOS setting for this motherboard 
apply for most conditions with optimum 
performance. We do not suggest users change 
the default values in the BIOS setup and take no 
responsibility to any damage caused by changing 
the BIOS settings.

Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this 
motherboard from the manufacturer’s Website. New BIOS 
provides support for new peripherals, improvements in 
performance, or fixes for known bugs. Install new BIOS as 
follows:
1  If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, 
change the setting to allow BIOS flashing.
2  If your motherboard has an item called Firmware 
Write Protect in Advanced BIOS features, disable it. 
(Firmware Write Protect prevents BIOS from being 
overwritten.)
3  Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable 
system disk. (Refer to Windows online help for 
information on creating a bootable system disk.)
4  Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the 
manufacturer’s Web site. Copy these files to the 
bootable device.
5  Turn off your computer and insert the bootable 
device in your computer. (You might need to run 
the Setup Utility and change the boot priority items 
on the Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force 
your computer to boot from the bootable device 
first.)
