Using BIOS
About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc.” BIOS 
with support for Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on 
the motherboard contains the ROM setup instructions for 
configuring the motherboard BIOS. 
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays 
the system’s configuration status and provides you with 
options to set system parameters. The parameters are stored in 
battery-backedup CMOS RAM that saves this information when 
the power is turned off. When the system is turned back on, 
the system is configured with the values you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
•  Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
•  Video display type and display options
•  Password protection from unauthorized use
•  Power Management features
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer 
performs. Before using the Setup Utility, ensure that you 
understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.

Chapter 2
The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility. 
However, we recommend that you read this chapter in case 
you need to make any changes in the future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
•  when changing the system configuration
•  when a configuration error is detected and you are 
prompted to make changes to the Setup Utility
•  when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
•  when making changes to the Power Management 
configuration
•  when changing the password or making other changes 
to the Security Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On 
Self Test (POST) routines. POST is a series of built-in diagnostics 
performed by the BIOS. After the POST routines are completed, 
the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP
Press the delete key to access BIOS Setup Utility.

Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this motherboard 
from the manufacturer’s Website. New BIOS provides support 
for new peripherals, improvements in performance, or fixes for 
known bugs. Install new BIOS as follows:
1  If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, 
change the setting to allow BIOS flashing.
2  If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write 
Protect in Advanced BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware 
Write Protect prevents BIOS from being overwritten.)
3  Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system 
disk. (Refer to Windows online help for information on 
creating a bootable system disk.)
4  Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the 
manufacturer’s Web site. Copy these files to the bootable 
device.
5  Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device 
in your computer. (You might need to run the Setup 
Utility and change the boot priority items on the 
Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force your 
computer to boot from the bootable device first.)
6  At the fs0:\>prompt, type the Flash Utility program 
name and the file name of the new BIOS and then press 
<Enter>. Example: AFUEFIX64.EFI 240131_CAP.cap
7  When the installation is complete, remove the bootable 
device from the computer and restart your computer. 
If your motherboard has a Flash BIOS jumper, reset the 
jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from being 
overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.
This concludes Chapter 3. Refer to the next chapter for information 
on the software supplied with the motherboard.

Using the Motherboard Software
Installing the Windows OS
Install Windows OS via USB flash drive.
a)  Create an ISO file from the Windows 11 DVD.
  This free program from Microsoft properly formats 
your flash drive and then copies the contents of the 
Windows 11 installation ISO file to the flash drive.
b)  Boot from the USB device that you just created to start 
the Windows 11 installing process.
You need to change the booting priority in BIOS in order 
to boot from USB device. Enter into BIOS and select the 
Boot in menu (or press the hotkey F7), set USB drive as 
the first booting priority.
Manual Installation
Most drivers have a setup program (SETUP.EXE)
that automatically detects your operating system before 
installation. Other drivers have the setup program located in 
the operating system subfolder. 
If the driver you want to install does not have a setup program, 
browse to the operating system subfolder and locate the 
readme text file (README.TXT or README.DOC) for information 
on installing the driver or software for your operating system.
