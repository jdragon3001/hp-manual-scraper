Using BIOS
About the Setup Utility
The computer uses the latest “American Megatrends Inc. ” BIOS with support for
Windows Plug and Play. The CMOS chip on the motherboard contains the ROM
setup instructions for configuring the motherboard BIOS.
The BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) Setup Utility displays the system’s
configuration status and provides you with options to set system parameters. The
parameters are stored in battery-backed-up CMOS RAM that saves this information
when the power is turned off. When the system is turned back on, the system is
configured with the values you stored in CMOS.
The BIOS Setup Utility enables you to configure:
• Hard drives, diskette drives and peripherals
• Video display type and display options
• Password protection from unauthorized use
• Power Management features
The settings made in the Setup Utility affect how the computer performs. Before
using the Setup Utility, ensure that you understand the Setup Utility options.
This chapter provides explanations for Setup Utility options.
The Standard Configuration
A standard configuration has already been set in the Setup Utility. However, we
recommend that you read this chapter in case you need to make any changes in the
future.
This Setup Utility should be used:
• when changing the system configuration
• when a configuration error is detected and you are prompted to make
changes to the Setup Utility
• when trying to resolve IRQ conflicts
• when making changes to the Power Management configuration
• when changing the password or making other changes to the Security
Setup
Entering the Setup Utility
When you power on the system, BIOS enters the Power-On Self Test (POST)
routines. POST is a series of built-in diagnostics performed by the BIOS. After the
POST routines are completed, the following message appears:
Press DEL to enter SETUP

Updating the BIOS
You can download and install updated BIOS for this motherboard from the
manufacturer’s Web site. New BIOS provides support for new peripherals,
improvements in performance, or fixes for known bugs. Install new BIOS as follows:
1 If your motherboard has a BIOS protection jumper, change the setting to
allow BIOS flashing.
2 If your motherboard has an item called Firmware Write Protect in
Advanced BIOS features, disable it. (Firmware Write Protect prevents
BIOS from being overwritten.)
3 Prepare a bootable device or create a bootable system disk. (Refer to
Windows online help for information on creating a bootable system
disk.)
4 Download the Flash Utility and new BIOS file from the manufacturer’s
Web site. Copy these files to the bootable device.
5 Turn off your computer and insert the bootable device in your
computer. (You might need to run the Setup Utility and change the boot
priority items on the Advanced BIOS Features Setup page, to force
your computer to boot from the bootable device first.)
6 At the C:\ or A:\ prompt, type the Flash Utility program name and the file
name of the new BIOS and then press <Enter>. Example: AFUDOS.EXE
040706.ROM
7 When the installation is complete, remove the bootable device from the
computer and restart your computer. If your motherboard has a Flash
BIOS jumper, reset the jumper to protect the newly installed BIOS from
being overwritten. The computer will restart automatically.

Auto-installing under Windows 7/8/10
The support software DVD-ROM/CD-ROM disk loads automatically under Windows
7/8/10. When you insert the DVD-ROM/CD-ROM disk in the DVD-ROM/CD-ROM
drive, the autorun feature will automatically bring up the install screen. The screen
has three buttons on it, Setup, Browse CD and Exit.
If the opening screen does not appear; double-click the file “setup.exe”
in the root directory.
If the Auto-install DVD-ROM/CD-ROM does not work on your system,
you can still install drivers through the file manager for your OS (for
example, Windows Explorer). Refer to the Utility Folder Installation Notes
later in this chapter.
About the Software DVD-ROM/CD-ROM
The support software DVD-ROM/CD-ROM that is included in the motherboard
package contains all the drivers and utility programs needed to properly run the
bundled products. Below you can find a brief description of each software program,
and the location for your motherboard version. More information on some
programs is available in a README file, located in the same directory as the
software. Before installing any software, always inspect the folder for files named
README.TXT or something similar. These files may contain important
information that is not included in this manual.
Never try to install all software from folder that is not specified for use with
your motherboard.
The notice of Intel HD audio installation (optional): The Intel High Defi-
nition audio functionality unexpectedly quits working in Windows Server
2003 Service Pack 1 or Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. Users need
to download and install the update packages from the Microsoft Download
Center “before” installing HD audio driver bundled in the Driver disk.

Using the Software
Manual Installation
Insert the disk in the DVD-ROM/CD-ROM drive and locate the PATH.DOC file in
the root directory. This file contains the information needed to locate the drivers for
your motherboard.
Look for the chipset and motherboard model; then browse to the directory and path
to begin installing the drivers. Most drivers have a setup program (SETUP.EXE) that
automatically detects your operating system before installation. Other drivers have
the setup program located in the operating system subfolder.
If the driver you want to install does not have a setup program, browse to the
operating system subfolder and locate the readme text file (README.TXT or
README.DOC) for information on installing the driver or software for your
operating system.

Trouble Shooting
Start up problems during assembly
After assembling the PC for the first time you may experience some start up
problems. Before calling for technical support or returning for warranty, this chapter
may help to address some of the common questions using some basic troubleshooting
tips.
a) System does not power up and the fans are not running.
1.Disassemble the PC to remove the VGA adaptor card, DDR memory, LAN, USB
and other peripherals including keyboard and mouse. Leave only the motherboard,
CPU with CPU cooler and power supply connected. Turn on again to see if the
CPU and power supply fans are running.
2. Make sure to remove any unused screws or other metal objects such as screwdrivers
from the inside PC case. This is to prevent damage from short circuit.
3. Check the CPU FAN connector is connected to the motherboard.
4. For Intel platforms check the pins on the CPU socket for damage or bent. A bent
pin may cause failure to boot and sometimes permanent damage from short circuit.
5. Check the 19V power connector is connected to the motherboard.
6. Check that the 19V power is fully inserted into the motherboard connectors.
Make sure the latches of the cable and connector are locked into place.
b) Power is on,   fans are running but there is no display
1. Make sure the monitor is turned on and the monitor cable is properly connected
to the PC.
2. Check the VGA adapter card (if applicable) is inserted properly.
3. Listen for beep sounds. If you are using internal PC speaker make sure it is
connected.

   b. 1 long beep and 8 short beeps : VGA not detected

c) The PC suddenly shuts down while booting up.
1. The CPU may experience overheating so it will shutdown to protect itself.
Ensure the CPU fan is working properly.
2. From the BIOS setting, try to disable the Smartfan function to let the fan run at
default speed. Doing a Load Optimised Default will also disable the Smartfan.
Your computer, like any electrical appliance, requires proper care and maintenance.
Here are some basic PC care tips to help prolong the life of the motherboard and
keep it running as best as it can.
1. Keep your computer in a well ventilated area. Leave some space between
   the PC and the wall for sufficient airflow.
2. Keep your computer in a cool dry place. Avoid dusty areas, direct sunlight
Start up problems after prolong use
After a prolong period of use your PC may experience start up problems again.
This may be caused by breakdown of devices connected to the motherboard such as
HDD, CPU fan, etc. The following tips may help to revive the PC or identify the
cause of failure.
1. Clear the CMOS values using the CLR_CMOS jumper. Refer to CLR_CMOS
jumper in Chapter 2 for Checking Jumper Settings in this user manual. When
completed, follow up with a Load Optimised Default in the BIOS setup.
2. Check the system fan for dust. Long term accumulation of dust will reduce its
effectiveness to cool the processor. Clean the cooler or replace a new one if
necessary.
3. Remove the hard drive, optical drive or DDR memory to determine which of
these component may be at fault.
Maintenance and care tips
   and areas of high moisture content.
3. Routinely clean the CPU cooler fan to remove dust and hair.
4. In places of hot and humid weather you should turn on your computer once
   every other week to circulate the air and prevent damage from humidity.
5. Add more memory to your computer if possible. This not only speeds up the
   system but also reduces the loading of your hard drive to prolong its life span.
6. If possible, ensure the power cord has an earth ground pin directly from the
   wall outlet. This will reduce voltage fluctuation that may damage sensitive devices.
