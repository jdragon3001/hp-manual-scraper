User Guide – September 2019 
1.0  Introduction 
This User Guide provides step-by-step installation instructions for the Intel® NUC 8 Rugged Kit NUC8CCHKR. 
Before You Begin 
  CAUTIONS 
The steps in this guide assume you’re familiar with computer terminology and with the safety practices and 
regulatory compliance required for using and modifying computer equipment. 
 
Disconnect the computer from its power source and from any network before performing any of the steps 
described in this guide.   
Failure to disconnect power, telecommunications links, or networks before you open the computer or perform 
any procedures can result in personal injury or equipment damage.  Some circuitry on the board can continue 
to operate even though the front panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
•  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
•  Create a log to record information about your computer, such as model, serial numbers, installed options, and 
configuration information. 
•  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the procedures described in this chapter 
only at an ESD workstation using an antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam pad. If such a station isn’t 
available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an antistatic wrist strap and attaching it to a metal 
part of the computer chassis. 
Installation Precautions 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the installation instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
•  Sharp pins on connectors 
•  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
•  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
•  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
•  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you don’t follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility of noncompliance with 
regional laws and regulations.

keyholes. 
 
1.  Attach the two large silver screws to the monitor’s VESA mount. 
 
2.  Slide the Intel NUC onto the VESA mount bracket, lining up the keyholes to the 
screws.
