Before You Begin 
 
  CAUTIONS 
The steps in this guide assume you’re familiar with computer terminology and with the safety 
practices and regulatory compliance required for using and modifying computer equipment. 
 
Disconnect the computer from its power source and from any network before performing any of the steps 
described in this guide.   
 
Failure to disconnect power, telecommunications links, or networks before you open the computer or 
perform any procedures can result in personal injury or equipment damage.  Some circuitry on the board 
can continue to operate even though the front panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
•  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
•  Create a log to record information about your computer, such as model, serial numbers, 
installed options, and configuration information. 
•  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the procedures described in 
this chapter only at an ESD workstation using an antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam 
pad. If such a station isn’t available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an 
antistatic wrist strap and attaching it to a metal part of the computer chassis. 
 
Installation Precautions
 
 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the installation 
instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
•  Sharp pins on connectors 
•  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
•  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
•  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
•  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
Observe all warnings and cautions that instruct you to refer computer servicing to qualified 
technical personnel. 
 
Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you don’t follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility of noncompliance 
with regional laws and regulations.

To install memory, follow these steps: 
 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer and 
disconnect the power cord. 
3.  Remove the computer’s bottom chassis cover. 
 
 
 
4.  Align the small space at the bottom edge of the memory module with the key in the socket. 
5.  Insert the bottom edge of the module at a 45-degree angle into the socket (A). 
6.  When the module is inserted, push down on the outer edge of module until the retaining 
clips snap into place (B). Make sure the clips are firmly in place (C). 
 
To remove a SO-DIMM, follow these steps: 
 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer and disconnect 
the power cord. 
3.  Remove the computer’s bottom chassis cover. 
4.  Gently spread the retaining clips at each end of the memory socket, which causes the module to 
pop out of the socket (C). 
5.  Holding the module by the edges, lift it away from the socket, and store it in an anti-static package. 
6.  Reinstall and reconnect any parts you removed or disconnected to reach the memory sockets. 
7.  Replace the computer’s cover and reconnect the power cord. 
 
Install an M.2 SSD or Intel® Optane™ Memory Module
 
 
The Intel NUC Kits NUC10i7FNH, NUC10i5FNH, and NUC10i3FNH support an 80mm or 42mm SSD.  
 
Find compatible M.2 SSDs in the Intel Product Compatibility Tool 
•  NUC10i7FNH 
•  NUC10i5FNH 
•  NUC10i3FNH 
 
NOTE 
Before changing the Intel Optane memory module, it needs to be disabled. Follow Removing 
Intel Optane Memory on this page first, before taking the module out.
