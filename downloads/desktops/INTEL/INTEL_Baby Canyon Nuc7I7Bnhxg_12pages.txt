Before You Begin 
 
  CAUTIONS 
The procedures in this guide assume familiarity with the general terminology associated with 
personal computers and with the safety practices and regulatory compliance required for using 
and modifying electronic equipment. 
 
Always disconnect the computer from its power source and from any network before performing any 
of the procedures described in this guide.   
 
Failure to disconnect power or networks before you open the computer or perform any procedures can 
result in personal injury and/or equipment damage.  Some circuitry on the board can continue to 
operate even though the front panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
  Create a log to record information about your computer, such as model, serial numbers, 
installed options, and configuration information. 
  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the procedures described in 
this chapter only at an ESD workstation using an antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam 
pad.  If such a station is not available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an 
antistatic wrist strap and attaching it to a metal part of the computer chassis. 
 
Installation Precautions
 
 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the installation 
instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
  Sharp pins on connectors 
  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
 
Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you do not follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility of 
noncompliance with regional laws and regulations.

Upgrading System Memory
 
 
The Intel NUC Kits NUC7i3BNHXF, NUC7i5BNHXF and NUC7i7BNHXG have two 260-pin DDR4 SO-
DIMM sockets.  
Pre-installed memory  
NUC7i3BNHXF 
One 4GB memory module 
NUC7i5BNHXF 
One 4GB memory module 
NUC7i7BNHXG 
One 8GB memory module 
 
To upgrade memory, be sure to select memory modules that meet these requirements:  
  1.2V low voltage memory 
  2133 MHz SO-DIMMs  
  Non-ECC 
Find compatible memory modules in the Intel Product Compatibility Tool 
  NUC7i3BNHXF 
  NUC7i5BNHXF 
  NUC7i7BNHXG 
 
NOTE 
If you plan to install only one memory module, install it in the lower memory 
socket. 
 
To upgrade or add memory, follow these steps: 
 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer and 
disconnect the power cord. 
3.  Remove the computer’s bottom chassis cover. 
 
Upgrade to different memory 
a.  Remove the pre-installed memory module 
i.  Gently spread the retaining clips at each end of the memory socket, which causes 
the module to pop out of the socket (C). 
ii.  Holding the module by the edges, lift it away from the socket, and store it 
in an anti-static package. 
b.  Install the new memory module 
i.  Align the small space at the bottom edge of the memory module with the 
key in the socket. 
ii.  Insert the bottom edge of the module at a 45 degree angle into the socket 
(A). 
iii.  When the module is inserted, push down on the outer edges of the 
module until the retaining clips snap into place (B).  Make sure the clips 
are firmly in place (C).

Install an additional memory module 
a.  Align the small space at the bottom edge of the memory module with the key on the 
socket. 
b.  Insert the bottom edge of the module at a 45 degree angle into the socket (A). 
c.  When the module is inserted, push down on the outer edges of the module until 
the retaining clips snap into place (B).  Make sure the clips are firmly in place (C). 
 
4.  Reinstall and reconnect any parts you removed or disconnected to reach the memory sockets. 
5.   Replace the computer’s cover and reconnect the power cord.
