Before You Begin 
 
  CAUTIONS 
The procedures in this user guide assume familiarity with the general terminology associated with 
personal computers and with the safety practices and regulatory compliance required for using 
and modifying electronic equipment. 
 
Disconnect the computer from its power source and from any telecommunications link or network before 
performing any of the procedures described in this guide.  Failure to disconnect power, 
telecommunications links, or networks before you open the computer or perform any procedures can 
result in personal injury or equipment damage.  Some circuitry on the board can continue to operate 
even though the front panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
  Set up a log to record information about your computer, such as model, serial numbers, 
installed options, and configuration information. 
  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the procedures described in 
this chapter only at an ESD workstation using an antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam 
pad.  If such a station is not available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an 
antistatic wrist strap and attaching it to a metal part of the computer chassis. 
 
Installation Precautions
 
 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the installation 
instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
  Sharp pins on connectors 
  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
Observe all warnings and cautions that instruct you to refer computer servicing to qualified 
technical personnel. 
 
Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you do not follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility of 
noncompliance with regional laws and regulations.

Installing and Removing Memory
 
 
Intel NUC Kits NUC7i3DNHE, NUC7i5DNHE, and NUC7i7DNHE have two 260-pin DDR4 SO-DIMM 
sockets. Memory requirements: 
  1.2V low voltage memory 
  1866 or 2133 MHz SO-DIMMs  
  Non-ECC 
 
Find compatible memory modules in the Intel® Product Compatibility Tool: 
  For Intel NUC Kit NUC7i3DNHE 
  For Intel NUC Kit NUC7i5DNHE 
  For Intel NUC Kit NUC7i7DNHE 
 
Install SO-DIMMs
 
 
If you plan to install just one SO-DIMM, install it in the lower memory socket. 
 
To install the SO-DIMMs, follow these steps: 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer and 
disconnect the AC power cord. 
 
 
 
3.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the SO-DIMM with the key in the socket. 
4.  Insert the bottom edge of the SO-DIMM into the socket. 
5.  When the SO-DIMM is inserted, push down on the outer edge of the SO-DIMM until the 
retaining clips snap into place.  Make sure the clips are firmly in place. 
 
Removing SO-DIMMs 
To remove a SO-DIMM, follow these steps: 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer. 
3.  Remove the AC power cord from the computer. 
4.  Remove the computer’s cover. 
5.  Gently spread the retaining clips at each end of the SO-DIMM socket.  The SO-DIMM pops out of

the socket. 
6.  Hold the SO-DIMM by the edges, lift it away from the socket, and store it in an anti-static 
package. 
7.  Reinstall and reconnect any parts you removed or disconnected to reach the SO-DIMM sockets. 
8.  Replace the computer’s cover and reconnect the AC power cord. 
 
 
Install an M.2 SSD
 
 
Intel NUC Kits NUC7i3DNHE, NUC7i5DNHE, and NUC7i7DNHE support 80mm M.2 devices. 
Find compatible M.2 SSDs in the Intel® Product Compatibility Tool: 
  For Intel NUC Kit NUC7i3DNHE 
  For Intel NUC Kit NUC7i5DNHE 
  For Intel NUC Kit NUC7i7DNHE 
 
 
To install an 80mm M.2 SSD: 
 
1.  Remove the small silver screw from the 80mm metal standoff on the motherboard (A). 
 
2.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the M.2 card with the key in the connector. 
 
3.  Insert the bottom edge of the M.2 card into the connector (B). 
 
4.  Secure the card to the standoff with the small silver screw (C). 
 
 
 
 
Install a 2.5” SSD or Hard Drive
 
 
Find compatible 2.5” SSDs and hard drives in the Intel® Product Compatibility Tool:
