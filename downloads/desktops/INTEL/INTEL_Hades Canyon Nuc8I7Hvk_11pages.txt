Before You Begin 
 
  CAUTIONS 
The procedures in this user guide assume familiarity with the general terminology associated with 
personal computers and with the safety practices and regulatory compliance required for using 
and modifying electronic equipment. 
 
Disconnect the computer from its power source and from any telecommunications link or network before 
performing any of the procedures described in this guide.  Failure to disconnect power, 
telecommunications links, or networks before you open the computer or perform any procedures can 
result in personal injury or equipment damage.  Some circuitry on the board can continue to operate even 
though the front panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
  Set up a log to record information about your computer, such as model, serial numbers, 
installed options, and configuration information. 
  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the procedures described in 
this chapter only at an ESD workstation using an antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam 
pad.  If such a station is not available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an 
antistatic wrist strap and attaching it to a metal part of the computer chassis. 
 
Installation Precautions 
 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the installation 
instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
  Sharp pins on connectors 
  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
Observe all warnings and cautions that instruct you to refer computer servicing to qualified technical 
personnel. 
 
Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you do not follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility of 
noncompliance with regional laws and regulations.

Installing and Removing Memory 
 
The Intel NUC Kits NUC8i7HNK and NUC8i7HVK have two 260-pin DDR4 SO-DIMM sockets. Memory 
requirements: 
  1.2V low voltage memory 
  2400 MHz SO-DIMMs  
  Non-ECC 
Find tested memory at the Intel® Product Compatibility Tool for: 
  Intel NUC Kit NUC8i7HNK 
  Intel NUC Kit NUC8i7HVK 
 
NOTE 
If only installing one SO-DIMM, install it in the lower memory socket. 
 
To install memory, follow these steps: 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer and disconnect 
the AC power cord. 
 
 
 
3.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the SO-DIMM with the key in the socket. 
4.  Insert the bottom edge of the SO-DIMM into the socket. 
5.  When the SO-DIMM is inserted, push down on the outer edge of the SO-DIMM until the 
retaining clips snap into place.  Make sure the clips are firmly in place. 
 
To remove memory, follow these steps: 
1.  Observe the precautions in “Before You Begin” on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer. 
3.  Remove the AC power cord from the computer. 
4.  Remove the computer’s cover. 
5.  Gently spread the retaining clips at each end of the SO-DIMM socket.  The SO-DIMM pops out of 
the socket. 
6.  Hold the SO-DIMM by the edges, lift it away from the socket, and store it in an anti-static package. 
7.  Reinstall and reconnect any parts you removed or disconnected to reach the SO-DIMM sockets. 
8.  Replace the computer’s cover and reconnect the AC power cord.

Installing an M.2 SSD 
 
Intel NUC Kits NUC8i7HNK and NUC8i7HVK support both 80mm and 42mm SSDs. 
 
Find compatible M.2 SSDs at the Intel® Product Compatibility Tool for: 
  Intel NUC Kit NUC8i7HNK 
  Intel NUC Kit NUC8i7HVK 
 
 
To install an 80mm M.2 SSD: 
 
1.  Remove the small silver screw from the 80mm metal standoff on the motherboard (A). 
2.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the M.2 card with the key in the connector. 
3.  Insert the bottom edge of the M.2 card into the connector (B). 
4.  Secure the card to the standoff with the small silver screw (C). 
 
 
 
To install a 42mm M.2 SSD: 
 
1.  Remove the small silver screw from the metal standoff on the motherboard (A). 
2.  Move the standoff (B) from the 80mm position to the 42mm position (C). 
3.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the M.2 card with the key in the connector. 
4.  Insert the bottom edge of the M.2 card into the connector (D). 
5.  Secure the card to the standoff with the small silver screw (E).

Closing the Chassis 
 
After all the components have been installed, close the Intel NUC chassis. Intel recommends this be done 
by hand with a screwdriver to avoid over-tightening and possibly damaging the screws. 
 
1.  Place the top plate on the NUC chassis. 
 
 
 
 
2.  Reattach the cable and secure the screw with a screwdriver. 
 
3.  Place the top lid on the NUC and use the hex tool to tighten all the screws.
