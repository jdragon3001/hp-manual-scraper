User Guide – April 2019 
1.0  Introduction 
This User Guide provides step-by-step installation instructions for these products: 
 
•  Intel® NUC 8 Mainstream-G mini PC NUC8i7INH 
•  Intel® NUC 8 Mainstream-G mini PC NUC8i5INH 
1.1  Before You Begin 
  CAUTIONS 
The steps in this guide assume you’re familiar with computer terminology and 
with the safety practices and regulatory compliance required for using and 
modifying computer equipment. 
 
Disconnect the computer from its power source and from any network before 
performing any of the steps described in this guide.   
Failure to disconnect power, telecommunications links, or networks before you open 
the computer or perform any procedures can result in personal injury or equipment 
damage.  Some circuitry on the board can continue to operate even though the front 
panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
•  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
•  Create a log to record information about your computer, such as model, 
serial numbers, installed options, and configuration information. 
•  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the 
procedures described in this chapter only at an ESD workstation using an 
antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam pad. If such a station isn’t 
available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an antistatic wrist 
strap and attaching it to a metal part of the computer chassis. 
1.2  Installation Precautions 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the 
installation instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
•  Sharp pins on connectors

User Guide – April 2019 
•  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
•  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
•  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
•  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
Observe all warnings and cautions that instruct you to refer computer servicing 
to qualified technical personnel. 
1.3  Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you don’t follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility 
of noncompliance with regional laws and regulations.

11.0  Operating System Recovery 
There’s a Windows recovery partition on the Intel NUC. You can use this partition to 
Refresh, Reset, or Restore Windows. Here is what each of these actions do: 
 
Refresh  
 
If your PC isn't performing as well as it once did, and you don't 
know why, you can refresh your PC. This action doesn’t delete any 
of your personal files or change your settings. Refresh does the 
following: 
 
•  Files and personalization settings won’t change.  
•  PC settings are changed back to their defaults.  
•  Apps from the Windows Store are kept.  
•  Apps installed from disks or websites are removed.  
•  List of removed apps is saved on the desktop. 
 
Reset  
 
If you want to recycle your PC, give it away, or start over with it, you 
can reset it completely. This process removes everything. Reset 
does the following: 
 
•  All personal files and apps are removed.  
•  PC settings are changed back to their defaults.  
•  Windows is reinstalled. 
 
Restore 
If a recently installed app or driver is causing problems with your 
PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, 
called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your 
personal files, but it can remove recently installed apps and 
drivers. 
 
 
Caution - Before performing a Refresh or Reset: 
 
•  Make sure to back up all personal data to external storage.  
•  Remove SD card from the card slot, if one is inserted.
