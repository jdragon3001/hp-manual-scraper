Before You Begin 
 
  CAUTIONS 
The steps in this guide assume you’re familiar with computer terminology and with the safety 
practices and regulatory compliance required for using and modifying computer equipment. 
 
Disconnect the computer from its power source and from any network before performing any of the steps 
described in this guide.   
 
Failure to disconnect power, telecommunications links, or networks before you open the computer or 
perform any procedures can result in personal injury or equipment damage.  Some circuitry on the board 
can continue to operate even though the front panel power button is off. 
 
Follow these guidelines before you begin: 
•  Always follow the steps in each procedure in the correct order. 
•  Create a log to record information about your computer, such as model, serial numbers, 
installed options, and configuration information. 
•  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components.  Perform the procedures described in 
this chapter only at an ESD workstation using an antistatic wrist strap and a conductive foam 
pad. If such a station isn’t available, you can provide some ESD protection by wearing an 
antistatic wrist strap and attaching it to a metal part of the computer chassis. 
 
Installation Precautions
 
 
When you install and test the Intel NUC, observe all warnings and cautions in the installation 
instructions. 
 
To avoid injury, be careful of: 
•  Sharp pins on connectors 
•  Sharp pins on circuit boards 
•  Rough edges and sharp corners on the chassis 
•  Hot components (such as SSDs, processors, voltage regulators, and heat sinks) 
•  Damage to wires that could cause a short circuit 
 
Observe all warnings and cautions that instruct you to refer computer servicing to qualified 
technical personnel. 
 
Observe Safety and Regulatory Requirements 
If you don’t follow these instructions, you increase your safety risk and the possibility of noncompliance 
with regional laws and regulations.

Installing and Removing Memory
 
 
Intel NUC Kits NUC10i7FNK, NUC10i5FNK and NUC10i3FNK have two 260-pin DDR4 SO-DIMM sockets. 
Memory requirements: 
•  1.2V low voltage memory 
•  2666 MHz SO-DIMMs  
•  Non-ECC 
Find compatible memory modules in the Intel Product Compatibility Tool 
•  NUC10i7FNK 
•  NUC10i5FNK 
•  NUC10i3FNK 
 
NOTE 
If you plan to install only one memory module, install it in the lower memory 
socket.

Install SO-DIMMs
 
 
If you plan to install just one SO-DIMM, install it in the lower memory socket. 
 
To install the SO-DIMMs, follow these steps: 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer and disconnect 
the AC power cord. 
 
 
 
3.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the SO-DIMM with the key in the socket. 
4.  Insert the bottom edge of the SO-DIMM into the socket. 
5.  When the SO-DIMM is inserted, push down on the outer edge of the SO-DIMM until the 
retaining clips snap into place. Make sure the clips are firmly in place. 
 
Removing SO-DIMMs 
To remove a SO-DIMM, follow these steps: 
1.  Observe the precautions in "Before You Begin" on page 2. 
2.  Turn off all peripheral devices connected to the computer.  Turn off the computer. 
3.  Remove the AC power cord from the computer. 
4.  Remove the computer’s cover. 
5.  Gently spread the retaining clips at each end of the SO-DIMM socket.  The SO-DIMM pops out of 
the socket. 
6.  Hold the SO-DIMM by the edges, lift it away from the socket, and store it in an anti-static 
package. 
7.  Reinstall and reconnect any parts you removed or disconnected to reach the SO-DIMM sockets. 
8.  Replace the computer’s cover and reconnect the AC power cord.

Install an M.2 SSD
 
 
Intel NUC Kits NUC10i7FNK, NUC10i5FNK and NUC10i3FNK support 80mm and 42mm SSDs. 
 
Find compatible M.2 SSDs at the Intel® Product Compatibility Tool: 
•  NUC10i7FNK 
•  NUC10i5FNK 
•  NUC10i3FNK 
 
NOTE 
Before changing the Intel Optane memory module, it needs to be disabled. Follow Removing 
Intel Optane Memory on this page first, before taking the module out. 
 
If you’re installing an 80mm M.2 SSD: 
 
1.  Remove the small silver screw from the 80mm (A) and 42mm (B) metal standoff on the 
motherboard. 
 
2.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the M.2 card with the key in the connector. 
 
3.  Insert the bottom edge of the M.2 card into the connector (C). 
 
4.  Secure the card to the standoff with the small silver screw (D). 
 
 
 
 
 
If you’re installing a 42mm M.2 SSD: 
 
1.  Remove the small silver screw from the metal standoff on the motherboard (A). 
 
2.  Align the small notch at the bottom edge of the M.2 card with the key in the connector. 
 
3.  Insert the bottom edge of the M.2 card into the connector (B). 
 
4.  Secure the card to the standoff with the small silver screw (C).

Follow these instructions to attach and use the VESA mount bracket: 
 
1.  Using the four small black screws that were included in the box, attach the VESA bracket to the 
back of the monitor or TV.
