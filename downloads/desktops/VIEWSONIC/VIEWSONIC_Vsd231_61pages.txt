7.5 Protect Your Device Data with Face Unlock
From Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, Google had been introduced a new 
way to unlock your devices via front camera. The facial recognition unlock 
feature called Face Unlock will be an integral part of Android OS. Follow the 
steps to get the Face Unlock feature set up on your device:
1
Touch the Home button │ Apps button │ Settings │ Security.
2
Touch Screen Lock section → Face Unlock.
3
On the right half of the display, it will tell you that Face Unlock is not 
secure as other unlock options. Ensure that you have read all the 
warning messages and then select Set it up.
4
You’ll now be taken to a screen that gives you some hints on how to 
setup the photo of your face that will act as the unlocking mechanism 
on your device. Take heed and select Continue.
5
You will then see your face by courtesy of VSD231’s front camera. 
Move a little away from the front camera so your face ts in the 
Show Your Face screen. Center your face in the outlined area. You 
will receive a Face Captured screen if the Face Unlock setup was 
successful and then select Continue.
6
Once the Face Unlock is set to your face, you will be prompted to now 
set up a backup lock. In case the device does not recognize you (this 
can happen for a bunch of reasons) it will revert to another method 
for secure unlocking of the phone. Choose one of the two backup 
methods listed; Pattern or PIN. For a Pattern unlock, slide your nger 
to connect at least four dots in any pattern of your choosing. Repeat 
the pattern to conrm the choice. For a PIN unlock, simply input a four 
digit PIN and repeat to conrm.

Touch OK to nish the setup.
