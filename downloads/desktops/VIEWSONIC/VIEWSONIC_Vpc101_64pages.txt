the label side facing toward you and the disc is centered in the 
tray.
• Check the inserted disc is not dirty, bent, or damaged. If 
recording stops during a recording session, the disc probably 
is damaged. Please remove it and insert a different disc.
• Ensure that the inserted disc is writable, and it must be blank 
or appendable (with space to add more data files).
• Try writing the disc with other recording programs as some 
programs cannot write certain disc types. 
- If you intend to write data to DVD, make sure that you are 
recording the data with a DVD burning program.
• Select a slower write speed if you are not under a time 
constraint.
• Check if the added data files exceed the available space on 
the inserted writable disc.
• Ensure that there is enough space available on the hard disk 
drive to store the temporary files that are created during the 
writing process.

Troubleshooting
Display problems
Symptom Possible solution
There is nothing visi-
ble on the screen.
• Check the power cable and power adapter are well connected.
• Check the Power button indicator. 
- If the indicator does not light up, your computer is not being 
supplied power from an external power source via the power 
adapter. Check the connection between your computer, the 
power adapter, and the nearby outlet.
- If the indicator flashes in blue, your computer has entered 
Sleep mode. Move your mouse or click any button on the key-
board to wake the system. 
- If the Power button indicator lights up in blue, the computer is 
being supplied normally with power. Reconnect the power 
adapter and restart the system.
• Check if the LCD display power indicator stays green.
- If the indicator lights up in amber, your monitor has entered 
Sleep mode. Press the Power button on the front panel to 
turn on the screen.
• Check if the brightness level of the display is adjusted 
correctly, and is not set too low or too high. Use the 
Brightness control by pressing the Brightness/Increase or 
Decrease buttons on the front panel to adjust the brightness 
level.
The images on the 
screen are too large or 
too small, or the 
images are blurred.
• Press the Auto-adjust button on the front panel of the

Keyboard and mouse problems
Symptom Possible solution
Keyboard or mouse 
commands are not rec-
ognized by the com-
puter.
• If you are using a wired keyboard or mouse, check the cable 
connection between the unit and your computer.
• If you are using a wireless keyboard or mouse, check the 
following items.

pad is not activated. Press the <Num Lock> key to activate 
the numeric keypad.
The cursor moves 
slowly and does not 
respond to the move-
ment of the mouse.
• If you are using a traditional mouse, check the following items.
- Use a mouse pad or other rough surface under the mouse.
- Clean the mouse. Remove the mouse compartment cover 
and ball from the mouse and carefully wipe the mouse ball 
with a moistened cloth or scrap the rollers with a piece of firm 
paper to remove any dirt. Then leave the mouse ball for a 
while to dry out before reassembling the mouse.
• If you are using an optical mouse (either wired or wireless), 
refer the following items.
- Use a mouse pad or white sheet of paper under the mouse. 
- Clean the mouse by gently wiping the light sensor lens on the 
bottom of the mouse with a lint-free cloth. 
The cursor moves too 
fast or too slow.
• You may configure the cursor speed to meet your personal 
preferences.
- Click Start > Control Panel > Mouse to open the Mouse

Troubleshooting
Sound and microphone problems
Symptom Possible solution
I hear noise when con-
necting a headphone 
to the computer.
• Check if the earphone works well.
- Connect the earphone to other devices, such as a radio, to 
see if you can still hear that noise. If the noise persists, the 
earphone may be out of order.
• If you hear the noise only while inserting the earphone to the 
computer, it is resulted from high instantaneous current. This 
is a normal phenomenon.
I do not hear sound 
from the built-in speak-
ers. 
• Check if the speaker volume is set too low or is muted. 
- Click the volume icon,  , in the system tray to check the 
Windows volume controls.
- If you are using a program which has its own volume control, 
ensure the volume level is properly set.
• Unplug your headphone and external microphone if they have 
been connected to your computer.
The external micro-
phone does not work.
• Check if the external microphone is properly connected into 
the microphone jack on your computer. 
Certain audio files can-
not be played, and the 
Codec error messages 
appear.
• Check if Windows Media Player is set to automatically 
download codecs.
- Right-click on the menu bar, select Tools from the opened 
menu, and then click Options.
On the Player tab, in the Automatic updates area, select 
Once a day, and then click Apply and OK to complete the 
settings.
Then try playing the file again. If the audio file still cannot be 
played, it might require a codec that is not supported by Win-
dows Media Player. 
For more information about available codecs, see the docu-
mentation for Windows Media Player at the Microsoft web 
site.

The media card reader 
cannot read my mem-
ory card.
• Ensure that the memory card is fully inserted into the card 
reader slot.
• Ensure that the memory card is one of the supported types. 
For more information, see Media card reader. 
• Try restarting your computer. 
- When the computer is turned on, insert the card again. 
- Never insert or remove your memory cards when they are 
still in use, as this can cause loss of data or permanent dam-
age to the card.
USB devices quit 
working unexpectedly.
• Check if your USB devices are turned on. 
- Some USB devices are designed to conserve battery power 
by turning off automatically after a few minutes of inactivity. 
For example, your digital camera. Check if the connected 
USB device is turned on.
• Check if the USB port is working well.
- Try using another USB port to connect your USB device and 
see if the device is detected.
- Try connecting a low-powered USB device, such as a wired 
mouse, to the USB port to check if the port is working well.
• If you are using a USB hub, the power requirements of the 
USB port may be exceeded.
- Try connecting your USB device directly to the USB port on 
your computer.
• Check if you need to pre-install software before connecting 
your USB device. Read the documentation or user manual of 
the product.
