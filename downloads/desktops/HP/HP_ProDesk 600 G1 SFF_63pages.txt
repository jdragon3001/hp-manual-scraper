taskable as a Line-in or Microphone-in port. External speakers must be powered externally. Multi-streaming can be enabled in
the Realtek control panel to allow independent audio streams to be sent to/from the front and rear jacks. This allows for
different audio applications to use separate audio ports on the system. For example, the front jacks could be used with a

HP Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) Hard Drives maximize the performance ofHP Business PCs byproviding the
technologies tomeet your increasing storage demands with high-capacity drives offering superior reliability and performance.
SATA provides faster data transfer speeds, better system cooling airflow, more bandwidth, more headroom for speed increases in
future generations andbetter data integrity. A next-generation technology, the SATA interface connectshard drives to the PC
platform enabling easy aggregation of multiple hard drives into a single PC. This offers you the additional benefits of dedicated
bandwidth, the ability to more easily identify device failures and scalability. The HPProDesk 600 G1 Series Business PC supports
HP Serial ATA Hard Drives offer enhanced security via a newDrive Lock. When enabled, this ATA security feature set prevents
Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) hard drive technology allows hard drives to monitor their own health
and to raise flags ifimminent failures are predicted. If the drive determines that afailure is imminent, the SMARThard drive
technology enables theintelligent manageability or management software to generate a fault alert. While the current versionsof
SMART hard drives do a good job monitoring the data on the hard drive media, the everincreasing emphasis on reliability and
quality has promoted HP toimplement SMARTIV technologywhich constantly checks that the data flow fromhost interface to
media and media to hostinterface is not compromised. This is accomplished by inserting a 2 byte parity code into every 512 byte
block in the data path of the hard drive's Cache RAM. This unique parity checking performed byHP's SMART IV technology hard
drives, allows for more complete error detection coverageencompassing the entire data path between thehost and the hard drive.
NCQ or Native Command Queuing is a SATA protocol extension that allows the hard drive to have several write or read commands
outstanding at the same time. In contrast, normal non-queued operation requires each command to be completed before the next
command is issued bythe host system. Queuing allows the drive to complete the commands in the order that allows for best
overall throughput. It also involves an advanced method oftransferring data to or from the host, called First Party Direct Memory
Access (FPDMA), which allows the hard drive and the host controller to manage the datatransfers for multiple outstanding
commands, withoutinvolving the hostprocessor. NCQ cancontribute to better performance but the results are dependenton
many factors, including the access patterns of the various applications and operating system functions that are initiating drive
accesses. Enabling NCQ featuresin the hard drive requires AHCI support from the host system BIOS, controller, and driver. AHCI

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q1: Why is my desktop not turning on when I press the power button?
A1: Ensure the power cable is securely plugged into both the wall outlet and the back of the desktop. Check if the power button is functioning properly by pressing and holding it for at least 10 seconds. If the issue persists, it might be a power supply problem and professional assistance is recommended.

Q2: How can I connect my desktop to a Wi-Fi network?
A2: Make sure your desktop has a Wi-Fi adapter installed. Access the Windows Start menu, go to Settings, click on Network & Internet, and select Wi-Fi. Enable the Wi-Fi toggle switch if it's turned off, then select your desired network from the list and enter the password when prompted.

Q3: My desktop is running slow, what can I do to improve its performance?
A3: Close any unnecessary programs running in the background and ensure your desktop has adequate free storage space. Run a disk cleanup to remove temporary files and use the disk defragmenter tool to optimize the hard drive. Consider adding more RAM or upgrading the processor if needed.

Q4: How do I connect a second monitor to my desktop?
A4: Check if your desktop has an available video output port. Connect the second monitor to the port using the appropriate cable (e.g., HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA). Once connected, right-click on the desktop, select Display settings, and click on "Detect" to identify the second monitor. Adjust settings like resolution and orientation according to your preferences.

Q5: I accidentally deleted an important file, can I recover it?
A5: First, check the Recycle Bin on your desktop. If the file is there, right-click on it and select "Restore." If not, you may use a data recovery software such as Recuva or Disk Drill, which can help retrieve deleted files. Avoid saving any new files on the affected drive until recovery is performed to avoid overwriting the deleted data.

Q6: Does the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF have a water cooling system?
A6: No, the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF does not have a water cooling system. This means that the system relies on air cooling, which may be less efficient than water cooling for heavy use or overclocking.

Q7: What is the maximum internal memory of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF?
A7: The maximum internal memory of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF is 32 GB. This allows for a relatively large amount of RAM, which can improve the system's multitasking capabilities and overall performance.

Q8: How many memory slots does the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF have?
A8: The HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF has 4x DIMM memory slots. This provides flexibility for upgrading or expanding the system's memory capacity, allowing for future upgrades as needed.

Q9: What is the total storage capacity of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF?
A9: The total storage capacity of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF is 1000 GB. This provides a relatively large amount of storage space for storing files, documents, and media, which can be useful for users who require ample storage capacity.

Q10: Does the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF have a card reader integrated?
A10: Yes, the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF has a card reader integrated. This feature allows users to easily transfer files from memory cards, such as those from digital cameras or smartphones, directly to the computer without the need for additional peripherals.

Q11: What is the weight of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF?
A11: The HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF has a weight of 7600 g.

Q12: What is the height of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF?
A12: The HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF has a height of 100 mm.

Q13: What is HDMI?
A13: HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. An HDMI cable is used to transport audio and video signals between devices.

Q14: What is the width of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF?
A14: The HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF has a width of 338 mm.

Q15: What is the depth of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF?
A15: The HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF has a depth of 379 mm.

Q16: What does the download speed on the internet depend on?
A16: The download speed on the internet depends on the type of connection you have. If you have a 25 Mb/s connection this means that theoretically you should be able to download 25 MB per second.

Q17: How do I clean my keyboard?
A17: Hold the keyboard upside down and use a can of compressed air to blow away the dirt. The keys can even be cleaned with a damp cloth.

Q18: Is the manual of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF available in English?
A18: Yes, the manual of the HP ProDesk 600 G1 SFF is available in English .
