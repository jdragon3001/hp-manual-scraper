..........................................................................................................
 
015
 
• Do not force the unit’s power-supply cord to share 
an outlet with an unreasonable number of other 
devices. Be especially careful when using 
extension cords—the total power used by all 
devices you have connected to the extension cord’s 
outlet must never exceed the power rating (watts/
amperes) for the extension cord. Excessive loads 
can cause the insulation on the cord to heat up and 
eventually melt through.
 
..........................................................................................................
 
016

adaptor and clean it by using a dry cloth to wipe 
all dust and other accumulations away from its 
prongs. Also, disconnect the power plug from the 
power outlet whenever the unit is to remain unused 
for an extended period of time. Any accumulation 
of dust between the power plug and the power 
outlet can result in poor insulation and lead to fire.
 
..........................................................................................................
 
104
 
• Try to prevent cords and cables from becoming 
entangled. Also, all cords and cables should be 
placed so they are out of the reach of children.
 
..........................................................................................................
 
106

IMPORTANT NOTES
 
Power Supply
 
301
 
• Do not connect this unit to same electrical outlet that is being 
used by an electrical appliance that is controlled by an 
inverter (such as a refrigerator, washing machine, 
microwave oven, or air conditioner), or that contains a 
motor. Depending on the way in which the electrical 
appliance is used, power supply noise may cause this unit to 
malfunction or may produce audible noise. If it is not 
practical to use a separate electrical outlet, connect a power 
supply noise filter between this unit and the electrical outlet.
 
302
 
• The AC adaptor will begin to generate heat after long 
hours of consecutive use. This is normal, and is not a cause 
for concern.
 
307
 
• Before connecting this unit to other devices, turn off the 
power to all units. This will help prevent malfunctions and/
or damage to speakers or other devices.
 
Placement
 
351
 
• Using the unit near power amplifiers (or other equipment 
containing large power transformers) may induce hum. To 
alleviate the problem, change the orientation of this unit; or 
move it farther away from the source of interference.
 
352a
 
• This device may interfere with radio and television reception. 
Do not use this device in the vicinity of such receivers.
 
352b
 
• Noise may be produced if wireless communications 
devices, such as cell phones, are operated in the vicinity of 
this unit. Such noise could occur when receiving or initi-
ating a call, or while conversing. Should you experience 
such problems, you should relocate such wireless devices 
so they are at a greater distance from this unit, or switch 
them off.
 
354a
 
• Do not expose the unit to direct sunlight, place it near 
devices that radiate heat, leave it inside an enclosed 
vehicle, or otherwise subject it to temperature extremes. 
Excessive heat can deform or discolor the unit.
 
355b
 
• When moved from one location to another where the 
temperature and/or humidity is very different, water 
droplets (condensation) may form inside the unit. Damage 
or malfunction may result if you attempt to use the unit in 
this condition. Therefore, before using the unit, you must 
allow it to stand for several hours, until the condensation 
has completely evaporated.
 
358
 
• Do not allow objects to remain on top of the keyboard. This 
can be the cause of malfunction, such as keys ceasing to 
produce sound.
 
360
 
• Depending on the material and temperature of the surface 
on which you place the unit, its rubber feet may discolor or 
mar the surface.
You can place a piece of felt or cloth under the rubber feet 
to prevent this from happening. If you do so, please make 
sure that the unit will not slip or move accidentally.
 
Maintenance
 
401a
 
• For everyday cleaning wipe the unit with a soft, dry cloth or 
one that has been slightly dampened with water. To remove 
stubborn dirt, use a cloth impregnated with a mild, non-
abrasive detergent. Afterwards, be sure to wipe the unit 
thoroughly with a soft, dry cloth.
 
402
 
• Never use benzine, thinners, alcohol or solvents of any 
kind, to avoid the possibility of discoloration and/or defor-
mation.
 
Repairs and Data
 
452
 
• Please be aware that all data contained in the unit’s 
memory may be lost when the unit is sent for repairs. 
Important data should always be backed up on a USB 
memory, or written down on paper (when possible). During 
repairs, due care is taken to avoid the loss of data. 
However, in certain cases (such as when circuitry related to 
memory itself is out of order), we regret that it may not be 
possible to restore the data, and Roland assumes no 
liability concerning such loss of data.
 
Additional Precautions
 
551
 
• Please be aware that the contents of memory can be 
irretrievably lost as a result of a malfunction, or the 
improper operation of the unit. To protect yourself against 
the risk of loosing important data, we recommend that you 
periodically save a backup copy of important data you 
have stored in the unit’s memory or on a USB memory.
 
552
 
• Unfortunately, it may be impossible to restore the contents 
of data that was stored in the unit’s memory or on a USB 
memory once it has been lost. Roland Corporation assumes 
no liability concerning such loss of data.
 
553
 
• Use a reasonable amount of care when using the unit’s 
buttons, sliders, or other controls; and when using its jacks 
and connectors. Rough handling can lead to malfunctions.
 
554
 
• Never strike or apply strong pressure to the display.
 
556
 
• When connecting / disconnecting all cables, grasp the 
connector itself—never pull on the cable. This way you will 
avoid causing shorts, or damage to the cable’s internal 
elements.
 
558a
 
• To avoid disturbing your neighbors, try to keep the unit’s 
volume at reasonable levels. You may prefer to use 
headphones, so you do not need to be concerned about 
those around you (especially when it is late at night).
 
559a
 
• When you need to transport the unit, package it in the box 
(including padding) that it came in, if possible. Otherwise, 
you will need to use equivalent packaging materials.
 
561
 
• Use only the specified expression pedal (EV-5; sold 
separately). By connecting any other expression pedals, 
you risk causing malfunction and/or damage to the unit.

IMPORTANT NOTES
 
562
 
• Some connection cables contain resistors. Do not use 
cables that incorporate resistors for connecting to this unit. 
The use of such cables can cause the sound level to be 
extremely low, or impossible to hear. For information on 
cable specifications, contact the manufacturer of the cable.
 
563
 
• Unauthorized duplication, reproduction, hiring, and 
lending prohibited.
 
566b
 
• The sensitivity of the D Beam controller will change 
depending on the amount of light in the vicinity of the unit. 
If it does not function as you expect, adjust the sensitivity as 
appropriate for the brightness of your location.
 
Using USB Memory
 
704
 
• When connecting USB memory, firmly insert it all the way 
in.
 
705

impact.
• Do not leave USB memory in direct sunlight or in 
locations such as a closed-up automobile. (Storage 
temperature: 0–50 degrees C)
• Do not allow USB memory to become wet.
• Do not disassemble or modify USB memory.
 
Addition
 
• When connecting USB memory, position it horizontally with 
the USB memory connector and insert it without using 
excessive force. The USB memory connector may be 
damaged if you use excessive force when inserting USB 
memory.
 
Addition
 
• Do not insert anything other than USB memory (e.g., wire, 
coins, other types of device) into the USB memory 
connector. Doing so will damage the USB memory 
connector.
 
Addition
 
• Do not apply excessive force to the connected USB 
memory.
 
Addition
 
• Attach the USB memory cover when you’re not using USB 
memory.
 
Handling CD-ROMs
 
801
 
• Avoid touching or scratching the shiny underside (encoded 
surface) of the disc. Damaged or dirty CD-ROM discs may 
not be read properly. Keep your discs clean using a 
commercially available CD cleaner.

Introduction
 
What is a Performance? (p. 38)
 
A “Performance” is a group of settings that specifies the Tone 
and Style, the keyboard mode, and various other parameters.
 
What is a Tone? (p. 20)
 
On the GW-8, each of the sounds you normally play is called 
a “Tone.” If we use the analogy of an orchestra, a Tone 
corresponds to an instrument played by one of the musicians.
Tone settings, such as those for effects and filters, are stored in 
the Performance.
 
What is Backing? (p. 24)
 
“Backing” refers to the automatic accompaniment functionality 
of the GW-8.
There are three types of backing: you can choose from 
“STYLE,” “SONG,” and “USB MEMORY PLAYER.”
 
What is a Music Style? (p. 25)
 
A “Music Style” is a musical template used by a Backing. The 
GW-8 contains a variety of Music Styles such as rock, pop, 
Latin, and jazz. You can also add Style data by using a USB 
memory (p. 49).
 
* You can use the included “StyleConverter” software to 
create Styles on your computer.
 
What is a Song? (p. 27)
 
The GW-8 contains a 16-track MIDI song sequencer, which 
you can use to record the music you play. You can add a 
Backing to the performance you play on the keyboard, and 
save the result as a Song. You can also load Song data by 
using a USB memory.
 
What is a USB Memory Player? (p. 31)
 
This plays audio files or SMF data that has been stored in USB 
memory.
You can perform on the GW-8 accompanied by backing from 
an audio file or SMF.
Performance settings are stored in what is referred to as 
memory. There are three kind of memory: temporary, 
rewritable, and non-rewritable.
 
fig.Memory-Flow.eps
 
Temporary memory
 
Temporary area
 
This area holds the data of the Performance you’ve selected 
using the front panel buttons, and also holds the playlist you 
edited on the GW-8.
When you play the GW-8, sound is produced based on data 
in the temporary area. When you edit a performance, you do 
not directly modify the data in memory; rather, you call up the 
data into the temporary area, and edit it there.
Settings in the temporary area are temporary, and will be lost 
when the power is turned off or when you select another 
performance. To keep the settings you have modified, you 
must write them into rewritable memory.
 
Rewritable memory
 
System memory
 
System memory stores system parameter settings that 
determine how the GW-8 functions.
 
* Some settings cannot be overwritten. For details, refer to 
“System settings that are not stored” (p. 48).
 
User memory
 
User memory is where you normally store the data you need.
To store a Performance or a Song, execute Write procedure 
(p. 29, p. 41).

Introduction
 
Non-Rewritable memory
 
Preset memory
 
Data in Preset memory cannot be rewritten. However, you can 
call up settings from preset Performances into the temporary 
area, modify them and then store the modified data in 
rewritable memory.
 
USB memory
 
You can back up your settings to USB memory in the following 
units of data. (p. 49)
• Sound/System
User Performances, Favorite Tones/Performances, system 
settings
• Style
User Styles
• Song
User Songs
• All
Style and Song in addition to the Sound/System data 
listed above
 
To prevent malfunction and/or damage to speakers or other 
devices, always turn down the volume, and turn off the power 
on all devices before making any connections.
 
When connection cables with resistors are used, the volume 
level of equipment connected to the input (EXT INPUT jack) 
may be low. If this happens, use connection cables that do not 
contain resistors.
 
1.
 
Make sure that the [POWER] switch is off.
 
2.
 
Move the VOLUME knob all the way to the left to minimize 
the volume.
 
3.
 
Connect the included power cord to the included AC 
adaptor.
 
The indicator will light when you plug the AC adaptor into 
an AC outlet.
 
fig.ACadap.eps
 
Place the AC adaptor so the side with the indicator (see 
illustration) faces upwards and the side with textual 
information faces downwards.
 
Depending on your region, the included AC adaptor may be 
a different type than the one shown above. If so, omit step 3 
and proceed.
 
4.
 
Connect the AC adaptor to the DC IN jack on the GW-8’s 
rear panel, and then plug the AC adaptor into an electrical 
outlet.
 
To prevent the inadvertent disruption of power to your unit 
(should the plug be pulled out accidentally), and to avoid 
applying undue stress to the AC adaptor jack, anchor the 
power cord using the cord hook, as shown in the illustration. 
Even if the cord is fastened, strong tension applied to the cord 
may cause it to be damaged or broken. Be careful not to pull 
the cord accidentally, or to apply strong pressure to it.

Introduction
 
fig.codef.eps
 
The GW-8 is not equipped with an amplifier or speakers. In 
order to produce sound, you need to hook up audio 
equipment such as a monitor speaker or a stereo set, or use 
headphones.
You can record your playing (or a song recorded on the GW-
8) onto an audio recording device. Connect the OUTPUT jacks 
on the GW-8’s rear panel to the input jacks of your external 
device.
 
fig.connect.eps
 
Connecting a pedal and switch
 
You must switch off the GW-8’s power before you connect a 
pedal and/or switch.
Connect a separately available pedal switch (Roland DP 
Series) to the HOLD PEDAL jack on the rear panel. You can 
use this pedal switch to sustain notes even after taking your 
hands off the keyboard.
Connect a separately available pedal switch (Roland DP 
Series), a separately available foot switch (Boss FS-5U) or 
separately available expression pedal (Roland EV-5) to the 
rear panel CONTROL PEDAL jack. You can use this to control 
various functions that you assign (p. 38).
 
Use only the specified expression pedal (EV-5; sold 
separately). By connecting any other expression pedals, you 
risk causing malfunction and/or damage to the unit.
 
Connecting a portable audio player to 
 
the EXT INPUT jack
 
You can connect an MP3 player or other audio device to the 
GW-8’s EXT INPUT jack, and listen to the playback.
 
“Input settings for the EXT INPUT jack” (p. 17)
 
Turning the power on
 
Once the connections have been completed, turn on power to 
your various devices in the order specified. By turning on 
devices in the wrong order, you risk causing malfunction and/
or damage to speakers and other devices.
 
1.
 
Before you turn on the power, turn the [VOLUME] knob all 
the way to the left to minimize the volume.
 
2.
 
Press the rear panel [POWER] switch to turn on the power.
 
This unit is equipped with a protection circuit. A brief interval 
(a few seconds) after power up is required before the unit will 
operate normally.
 
If the GW-8 is connected to a keyboard amp or audio amp, 
turn on the power of the GW-8 first, and then switch on your 
amp.
 
3.
 
Turn the [VOLUME] knob to adjust the volume of the GW-8.

Keyboard Mode Functions
 
Immediately after you turn on the power, the GW-8 will be in 
a state where you can use the entire keyboard to play a piano 
sound. The GW-8’s keyboard can operate in one of the 
following three modes.
 
If BACKING TYPE [STYLE] is on, the left region of the 
keyboard (the Lower Part) is used to enter chords (p. 25).
 
Regardless of the current settings, you can easily select Single 
mode by choosing the “Piano setting” described below.
If the [SPLIT] and [DUAL] are off, the keyboard will be in 
Single mode, meaning that the entire keyboard will play a 
single Tone.
When you turn on the power, the GW-8 will be in this mode.
 
Using Piano setting
 
Regardless of the keyboard mode that is currently selected, 
you can use the following operation to call up the “Piano 
setting.”
This “Piano setting” will make the appropriate settings for 
playing piano on the GW-8; the entire keyboard will play a 
piano sound.
 
1.
 
Press [SPLIT] and [DUAL] simultaneously.
 
Such a division of the keyboard into right- and left-hand 
sections is called a “Split,” and the key where the division 
takes place is called the “Split Point.”
While in Split mode, a sound played in the right side is called 
an “Upper Tone,” and the sound played in the left side is 
called a “Lower Tone.” The Split-Point key is included in the 
upper section.
The Split Point has been set at the factory to C4.
 
1.
 
Press [SPLIT] so the button is lit.
 
The Tone you selected in Single mode will be the Tone for 
the Upper Part.
 
2.
 
To exit Split mode, press [SPLIT] once again so its light 
goes out. 
 
In Split mode, the most suitable octave settings for each Tone 
are applied automatically.
 
Changing the Split Point
 
1.
 
Press and hold [SPLIT] (for approximately two seconds).
 
The Split Point setting screen will appear.
 
2.
 
Turn the VALUE dial to change the Split Point.
 
3.
 
When you’re finished making the setting, press [EXIT].
 
You can also change the Split Point by holding down [SPLIT] 
and playing the desired key.
“Dual” is the mode in which two Tones are layered, so that 
they sound together.
In Dual mode, one Tone is called the “Upper Tone,” and the 
other is called the “Lower Tone.”
 
1.
 
Press [DUAL] so the button is lit.
 
The Tone you selected in Single mode will be the Tone for 
the Upper Part.
 
2.
 
To exit Dual mode, press [DUAL] once again so its light 
goes out. 
 
Playing Sounds from the 
Keyboard (Keyboard Mode)
 
SINGLE
 
The entire keyboard plays one Tone.
 
SPLIT
 
The region of the keyboard to the left of the Split 
Point becomes the Lower Part, while the region of 
the keyboard to the right of the Split Point 
becomes the Upper Part. Each part plays a 
different Tone.
 
DUAL
 
The entire keyboard plays two Tones 
simultaneously.

Keyboard Mode Functions
 
This setting determines how the volume changes in response to 
the force used to play the keyboard (Velocity Sensitivity).
 
The 
 
velocity
 
—the force with which you play the keyboard—
can affect the volume or timbre of a sound.
 
1.
 
Press [KEY TOUCH] so the button is lit.
 
The Key Touch window will open.
 
2.
 
Use the cursor buttons to select the item that you want to 
change, and use the VALUE dial to change the value.
 
3.
 
When you’ve finished making settings, press [KEY TOUCH] 
once again to close the window.
 
If you want to keep this setting, press [WRITE] to store it into 
the Performance (p. 41).
You can shift the pitch of the currently selected Tone upward 
or downward in steps of an octave, over a maximum of four 
octaves upward or downward.
 
1.
 
Press OCTAVE [ ] or [ ].
 
The Octave Shift window will open, and will then close a 
few moments after you release the button.
 
2.
 
While holding down OCTAVE [ ] or [ ], use Cursor 
[ ] [ ] to select the Tone whose pitch you want to 
shift.
 
3.
 
Use OCTAVE [ ] [ ] to change the octave.
 
By using the “Transpose function,” you can transpose your 
performance without changing the notes you play. You can 
also use this function to play back a song in a different key.
 
1.
 
Press [TRANSPOSE].
 
The Transpose window will open, and will then close a 
few moments after you release the button.
 
2.
 
While holding down [TRANSPOSE], use [ ] [ ] to 
select the item whose setting you want to change.
 
3.
 
Hold down [TRANSPOSE], and use the VALUE dial to

([KEY TOUCH])
 
Parameter
Value Explanation
Curve
 
LIGHT
Select this setting if you do not 
want velocity changes to bring 
about major volume changes.
MEDIUM
Medium velocity sensitivity. The 
keyboard responds to velocity 
changes, but the maximum 
volume can be obtained more 
easily than with “HEAVY.”
HEAVY
Select this setting for maximum 
expressiveness. Even small 
variations of the force with which 
you strike a key produce audible 
changes. The tradeoff is, 
however, that you have to strike 
the keys forcefully to achieve the 
maximum volume.
FIXED
Select this setting if all notes you 
play on the keyboard should have 
the same velocity value.
 
Value
 
1–127

Backing Track Functions
 
The GW-8 allows you to use the following three types of 
musical backing. To switch the backing type, use 
 
BACKING 
TYPE [STYLE], [SONG] 
 
and
 
 [USB MEMORY PLAYER]
 
.
 
[STYLE] (p. 25)
 
This backing uses the Music Styles. The GW-8 Style function 
automatically generates a backing with multiple instruments; 
simply choose one of a variety of Music Styles (Styles), then 
use your left hand to specify a chord. You can also choose 
Variations to change the backing in addition to the Intro, 
Main, and Ending backing types.
 
Using only the drum part of a Style as the 
backing
 
If you turn all of BACKING TYPE [STYLE], [SONG] and 
[USB MEMORY PLAYER] off, you’ll hear only the drum 
part of the currently selected Style. Just as when [STYLE] is 
on, you’ll be able to use the STYLE CONTROL buttons and 
VARIATION buttons to choose different variations.
 
[SONG] (p. 27)
 
You can use the recording function to record your own 
performance into the GW-8. Since a 16-track sequencer is 
built in, you can use multi-track recording to create a song by 
recording a different sound on each track. A song you’ve 
created can also be used as the backing for your keyboard 
performance.
SMF data can be loaded into the user Song and played back.
 
[USB MEMORY PLAYER] (p. 31)
 
This allows you to play back audio files or SMF data that’s 
been saved on USB memory. You can use this playback as the 
backing for your keyboard performance.
Use 
 
BALANCE [BACKING] 
 
and
 
 [KEYBOARD]
 
 to adjust the 
volume balance between the backing and your keyboard 
performance.
If you press 
 
BALANCE [BACKING] 
 
and
 
 [KEYBOARD] 
 
simultaneously, the volume balance will return to its original 
value.
If you’ve changed the volume balance, the button whose 
volume is higher will be lit.
 
This setting cannot be stored.
 
You can’t adjust the tempo of audio data.
 
1.
 
Press [TAP TEMPO] three or more times at the desired 
interval.
 
The tempo setting window will appear, and the tempo will 
be specified by the interval at which you pressed the 
button.
 
You can also specify the tempo by pressing [TAP TEMPO] to 
access the tempo setting window, and then using the cursor 
buttons and VALUE dial to specify the tempo. Press [EXIT] to 
close the tempo setting window.
 
Using the metronome
 
1.
 
Press [TAP TEMPO].
 
The tempo setting window will appear.
 
2.
 
Use the cursor buttons to move the cursor to “Metronome,” 
and use the VALUE dial to turn it on.
 
When you turn the metronome on, it will begin sounding.
 
3.
 
To stop the metronome, turn off “Metronome.”
 
4.
 
Press [EXIT] to return to the Main screen.

(Exporting to USB memory)
 
For details, refer to “Saving User Data to USB Memory 
(Backup)” (p. 49).
When 
 
[STYLE]
 
 is on, turning
 
 [ONE TOUCH]
 
 on (button lit) will 
assign the most suitable Tones for the currently selected Style 
as the Upper Tone and Lower Tone. This is called the “One 
Touch” function.
If 
 
[ONE TOUCH]
 
 is on when you switch Styles, the keyboard 
Tones will also switch to the Tones that are most suitable for 
the Style you selected.
To turn off the One Touch function, turn 
 
[ONE TOUCH]
 
 off 
(button unlit).
 
The Keyboard Mode (p. 19) will change depending on the 
selected Style.
 
Switching the Style when [ONE TOUCH] is on will not change 
the Split Point (p. 19).
 
You can’t change the Tones that are assigned to each Style by 
the One Touch function.

You can use the 16-track recorder of the GW-8 to record your 
own performances.
You can record your keyboard performance while listening to 
an accompaniment, and then listen to the playback of your 
recorded performance.
 
Recorded performances are discarded when another Song is 
selected, or when the power is turned off. If you don’t want to 
lose the Song, you must save it (p. 29).
On the GW-8, there are two ways to record a Song.
• Refer to “Recording in the Main screen” (p. 27).
• Refer to “Recording a specified Part (SONG TRACK)” (p. 
28).
 
Song settings (e.g., tempo and time signature) are determined 
by the settings of the Style that’s saved in the selected 
Performance. You’ll probably find it convenient to first select the 
Style and Tones that you want to use (p. 38). If you are 
performing without using a Style, you can specify the tempo and 
time signature of the Song in the SONG TRACK screen (p. 28).
 
Recording in the Main screen
 
If you want to record the Style playback as well, turn 
 
[STYLE]
 
 
on.
If you want to record only your keyboard performance without 
playing a Style, turn
 
 [SONG]
 
 on.
If 
 
[STYLE]
 
 and 
 
[SONG]
 
 are both turned off, the rhythm pattern 
of the Style selected by the 
 
STYLE SELECT buttons
 
 will be 
recorded together with the keyboard performance.
 
If you do the following procedure when any Song has been 
selected, you can record your performance on top of it.
If you want to record a new Song, use the Song Initializing 
operation. Refer to “Recording a specified Part (SONG 
TRACK)” (p. 28).

If you’re recording on a specified Part, recording with a Style 
may cause your performance to be recorded together with the 
performance generated by the Style, depending on the Part 
you’ve specified. If you’re recording on a specified Part, we 
recommend that you play without using Styles.

Performance Functions and Effects
 
The D Beam controller can be used simply by waving your 
hand over it. It can be used to apply various effects, 
depending on the function that is assigned to it. On the GW-8, 
the D Beam controller can be used not only to modify the 
sounds, but also to control the pitch of a monophonic (solo) 
synthesizer sound.
 
1.
 
Press either D BEAM [SOLO SYNTH], [ASSIGNABLE 1], or 
[ASSIGNABLE 2] to turn on the D Beam controller.
 
You can’t use these buttons at the same time.
 
2.
 
While you play the keyboard to produce sound, place 
your hand above the D Beam controller and move it slowly 
up and down.
 
3.
 
To turn off the D Beam controller, once again press the 
button you pressed in step 1 so the indicator goes out.
 
The sensitivity of the D Beam controller will change depending 
on the amount of light in the vicinity of the unit. If it does not 
function as you expect, adjust the D Beam Sens parameter as 
appropriate for the brightness of your location. Increase this 
value will raise the sensitivity (p. 47).

Performance Functions and Effects
 
A performance using a function that produces a sound such as 
DRUM ROLL can’t be recorded in a Song.
The Pitch Bend/Modulation lever located at the left of the 
keyboard can be used to apply two types of effect to the 
sound you’re playing in Keyboard mode.
 
Pitch Bend
 
 is an effect that lowers the pitch of the sound you’re 
playing when you move the lever toward the left, or raises it 
when you move the lever toward the right.
 
Modulation
 
 is an effect that applies vibrato to the sound you’re 
playing when you push the lever away from yourself.
 
If the MFX type is ROTARY, this will switch the rotational speed 
instead of Modulation.
 
fig.bendlever.eps
 
If you press the lever away from yourself while moving it to left 
or right, both effects will be applied at the same time.
 
The extent of the pitch change can be assigned for each Tone. 
For details, refer to “Pitch Bend Range” (p. 41).
 
“Bend Mode” (p. 46)
You can use the two 
 
ANALOG MODIFY knobs
 
 to modify the 
sound of the GW-8.
Use 
 
ANALOG MODIFY [SELECT]
 
 to choose the effect that the 
knobs will have.
 
MASTER EQ settings are stored in System settings (p. 46), and 
the other settings are stored in the Tone settings of the 
Performance (p. 41).
 
Adjusting the MASTER EQ
 
If you press 
 
ANALOG MODIFY [SELECT]
 
 to select MASTER EQ, 
the two knobs will operate as [LOW] and [HIGH] knobs.
Master EQ is applied to the overall output of the GW-8 that is 
sent from OUTPUT and PHONES.
 
If you want to keep these settings, press [WRITE] to save them 
in “SYSTEM.”

Using MIDI
 
The GW-8 can transmit and receive performance data when 
connected to an external MIDI device, which enables the two 
devices to control each other’s performance. For example, one 
device can play or switch sounds on the other device.
 
MIDI stands for “Musical Instrument Digital Interface.” It is a 
universal standard for exchanging musical performance data 
among electronic musical instruments and computers.
The GW-8’s MIDI connectors allow it to transmit performance 
data to, and receive such data from other devices. You can 
use the GW-8 in a wide range of ways by connecting external 
devices to these connectors.
 
Connection example
 
Before making connections with other devices, you must turn 
down the volume of all devices and turn off the power to avoid 
malfunctions or speaker damage.
 
fig.midi.eps
 
MIDI provides sixteen channels, numbered 1–16. Even if two 
MIDI devices are connected, you won’t be able to select or 
play sounds on the other device unless both devices are set to 
the same MIDI channel. The GW-8 is capable of receiving on 
all channels, 1–16.
If the GW-8’s BACKING TYPE [SONG] is on, MIDI channels 
1–16 will be received by “Track” 1–16.
If the GW-8’s BACKING TYPE [STYLE] is on, MIDI channels 1–
16 will be received by the “Style” Parts.
For details on how to make these settings, refer to “How to 
Make System Settings ([MENU])” (p. 46).
 
MIDI parameters other than “Local Switch” will be saved as 
soon as you exit system edit mode.
 
Local Switch
 
If the notes you play on the keyboard are sent to the sound 
generator via both of the two routes (1) and (2) as shown in 
the diagram, the notes will be duplicated or interrupted. To 
prevent this, you can disconnect route (1) by using the “Local 
Off” setting.
You should turn this setting Off if you’ve connected a MIDI 
sequencer to the GW-8.
 
fig.local.eps
 
Immediately after the power is turned on, this setting will be 
On.

Using MIDI
 
If you use a USB cable (commercially available) to connect the 
USB MIDI connector located on the GW-8’s rear panel to the 
USB connector of your computer, you’ll be able to do the 
following things.
• Use the GW-8 to play SMF played back by MIDI 
compatible software.
• By transferring MIDI data between the GW-8 and your 
sequencer software, you’ll be able to enjoy a wide range 
of possibilities for music production and editing.
Connect the GW-8 to your computer as shown below.
 
fig.PCconnect.eps
 
Refer to the Roland website for system requirements.
Roland website: http://www.roland.com/
 
If you are using Windows XP/Windows Vista, you must log 
onto Windows as one of the following users in order to 
complete the USB connection correctly.
• A user name belonging to the Administrators group, such 
as Administrator
• A user name whose account type is a computer administrator
 
Do not connect two or more GW-8 units to one computer via 
USB. The system will not operate correctly with such connections.
 
The file name for a Style or Song that can be used by the GW-
8 must be no longer than sixteen characters (not including the 
filename extension). You can use the following characters.
A–Z 0–9 ! # $ % & ‘ ( ) -  @ ^ _ ` { }
You must assign a filename extension of “.stl” to Style files, 
and a filename extension of “.mid” to Song files.
Depending on the type of characters you use, it may not be 
possible to display the file name in some cases.
 
If connection to your computer is 
 
unsuccessful...
 
Normally, you don’t need to install a driver in order to connect 
the GW-8 to your computer. However, if some problem 
occurs, or if the performance is poor, using the Roland 
original driver may solve the problem.
For details on downloading and installing the Roland original 
driver, refer to the Roland website.

Effects List
 
Some effect parameters (such as Rate or Delay Time) can be set in 
terms of a note value.
Such parameters have a num/note switch that lets you specify whether 
you will set the value as a note value or as a numerical value.
If you want to set Rate (Delay Time) as a numerical value, set the num/
note switch to “Hz” (“msec”). If you want to set it as a note value, set 
the num/note switch to “NOTE.”
* If the Rate is specified as a note value, the modulation will be 
synchronized with the tempo when you play back SMF song 
data.
 
note:
 
fig.MFX-note2.e_88
 
If you specify the delay time as a note value, slowing down the 
tempo will not change the delay time beyond a certain length. 
This is because there is an upper limit for the delay time; if the 
delay time is specified as a note value and you slow down the 
tempo until this upper limit is reached, the delay time cannot 
change any further. This upper limit is the maximum value that 
can be specified when setting the delay time as a numerical 
value.
The following 3D effects utilize RSS (Roland Sound Space) technology 
to create a spaciousness that cannot be produced by delay, reverb, 
chorus, etc.
52: 3D DELAY
29: 3D CHORUS
30: 3D FLANGER
31: 3D STEP FLANGER
When using these effects, we recommend that you place your 
speakers as follows. Also, make sure that the speakers are at a 
sufficient distance from the walls on either side.
 
fig.33-002
 
If the left and right speakers are too far apart, or if there is too much 
reverberation, the full 3D effect may not appear.
Each of these effects has an “Output Mode” parameter. If the sound 
from the OUTPUT jacks is to be heard through speakers, set this 
parameter to “SPEAKER.” If the sound is to be heard through 
headphones, set it to “PHONES.” This will ensure that the optimal 3D 
effect will be heard. If this parameter is not set correctly, the full 3D 
effect may not appear.

Effects List
 
The Rotary effect simulates the sound of the rotary speakers often used 
with the electric organs of the past. Since the movement of the high 
range and low range rotors can be set independently, the unique type 
of modulation characteristic of these speakers can be simulated quite 
closely. This effect is most suitable for electric organ Patches.
 
fig.MFX-21
 
This type provides modified response for the rotary speaker, with the 
low end boosted further.
This effect features the same specifications as the VK-7’s built-in rotary 
speaker.
 
fig.MFX-22
 
This is a stereo chorus. A filter is provided so that you can adjust the 
timbre of the chorus sound.

Effects List
 
This is a stereo flanger. (The LFO has the same phase for left and 
right.) It produces a metallic resonance that rises and falls like a jet 
airplane taking off or landing. A filter is provided so that you can 
adjust the timbre of the flanged sound.
 
fig.MFX-24
 
This is a flanger in which the flanger pitch changes in steps. The speed 
at which the pitch changes can also be specified in terms of a note-
value of a specified tempo.

Effects List
 
The GW-8’s Chorus effect unit can also be used as a stereo delay unit.
These settings allow you to select chorus or delay, and the characteristics of the selected effect type.
 
If you specify the delay time as a note value, slowing down the 
tempo will not change the delay time beyond a certain length. 
This is because there is an upper limit for the delay time; if the 
delay time is specified as a note value and you slow down the 
tempo until this upper limit is reached, the delay time cannot 
change any further. This upper limit is the maximum value that 
can be specified when setting the delay time as a numerical 
value.

* While under most conditions, a computer similar to the above 
will permit normal operation of the GW-8 applications, Roland 
cannot guarantee compatibility solely on these factors. This is due 
to numerous variables that may influence the processing 
environment, such as differences in motherboard design and the 
particular combination of other devices involved.
