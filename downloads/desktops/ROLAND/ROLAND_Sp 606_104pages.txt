USING THE UNIT SAFELY
 
001
 
• Before using this unit, make sure to read the 
instructions below, and the Owner’s Manual.
................................................................................................
 
002c
 
• Do not open (or modify in any way) the unit 
or its AC adaptor.
................................................................................................
 
003
 
• Do not attempt to repair the unit, or replace 
parts within it (except when this manual 
provides specific instructions directing you 
to do so). Refer all servicing to your retailer, 
the nearest Roland Service Center, or an 
authorized Roland distributor, as listed on 
the “Information” page.
................................................................................................
 
004
 
• Never use or store the unit in places that are:
• Subject to temperature extremes (e.g., 
direct sunlight in an enclosed vehicle, near 
a heating duct, on top of heat-generating 
equipment); or are
• Damp (e.g., baths, washrooms, on wet 
floors); or are
• Humid; or are
• Exposed to rain; or are
• Dusty; or are
• Subject to high levels of vibration.
................................................................................................
 
007
 
• Make sure you always have the unit placed 
so it is level and sure to remain stable. Never 
place it on stands that could wobble, or on 
inclined surfaces.
 
008c
 
• Be sure to use only the AC adaptor supplied 
with the unit. Also, make sure the line 
voltage at the installation matches the input 
voltage specified on the AC adaptor’s body. 
Other AC adaptors may use a different 
polarity, or be designed for a different 
voltage, so their use could result in damage, 
malfunction, or electric shock.
................................................................................................
 
009
 
• Do not excessively twist or bend the power 
cord, nor place heavy objects on it. Doing so 
can damage the cord, producing severed 
elements and short circuits. Damaged cords 
are fire and shock hazards!
................................................................................................
 
010
 
• This unit, either alone or in combination with 
an amplifier and headphones or speakers, 
may be capable of producing sound levels 
that could cause permanent hearing loss. Do 
not operate for a long period of time at a high 
volume level, or at a level that is uncom-
fortable. If you experience any hearing loss or 
ringing in the ears, you should immediately 
stop using the unit, and consult an audiol-
ogist.
................................................................................................
 
011
 
• Do not allow any objects (e.g., flammable 
material, coins, pins); or liquids of any kind 
(water, soft drinks, etc.) to penetrate the unit.
Used for instructions intended to alert 
the user to the risk of injury or material 
damage should the unit be used 
improperly. 
* Material damage refers to damage or 
other adverse effects caused with 
respect to the home and all its 
furnishings, as well to domestic 
animals or pets. 
Used for instructions intended to alert 
the user to the risk of death or severe 
injury should the unit be used 
improperly. 
The  ●  symbol alerts the user to things that must be 
carried out. The specific thing that must be done is 
indicated by the design contained within the circle. In 
the case of the symbol at left, it means that the power-
cord plug must be unplugged from the outlet. 
The      symbol alerts the user to important instructions 
or warnings.The specific meaning of the symbol is 
determined by the design contained within the 
triangle. In the case of the symbol at left, it is used for 
general cautions, warnings, or alerts to danger. 
The       symbol alerts the user to items that must never 
be carried out (are forbidden). The specific thing that 
must not be done is indicated by the design contained 
within the circle. In the case of the symbol at left, it 
means that the unit must never be disassembled. 
 
and registration marks to left or right.

012c
 
• Immediately turn the power off, remove the 
AC adaptor from the outlet, and request 
servicing by your retailer, the nearest Roland 
Service Center, or an authorized Roland 
distributor, as listed on the “Information” 
page when:
• The AC adaptor or the power-supply cord 
has been damaged; or
• If smoke or unusual odor occurs
• Objects have fallen into, or liquid has been 
spilled onto the unit; or
• The unit has been exposed to rain (or 
otherwise has become wet); or
• The unit does not appear to operate 
normally or exhibits a marked change in perfor-
mance.
................................................................................................
 
013
 
• In households with small children, an adult 
should provide supervision until the child is 
capable of following all the rules essential for 
the safe operation of the unit.
................................................................................................
 
014
 
• Protect the unit from strong impact.
  (Do not drop it!)
................................................................................................
 
015
 
• Do not force the unit’s power-supply cord to 
share an outlet with an unreasonable number 
of other devices. Be especially careful when 
using extension cords—the total power used 
by all devices you have connected to the 
extension cord’s outlet must never exceed the 
power rating (watts/amperes) for the 
extension cord. Excessive loads can cause the 
insulation on the cord to heat up and 
eventually melt through.
................................................................................................
 
016
 
• Before using the unit in a foreign country, 
consult with your retailer, the nearest Roland 
Service Center, or an authorized Roland 
distributor, as listed on the “Information” 
page.
................................................................................................
 
023
 
• DO NOT play a CD-ROM disc on a conven-
tional audio CD player. The resulting sound 
may be of a level that could cause permanent 
hearing loss. Damage to speakers or other 
system components may result.
 
101b
 
• The unit and the AC adaptor should be 
located so their location or position does not 
interfere with their proper ventilation.
................................................................................................
 
102d
 
• Always grasp only the output plug or the 
body of the AC adaptor when plugging into, 
or unplugging from, this unit or an outlet.
................................................................................................
 
103b
 
• At regular intervals, you should unplug the 
AC adaptor and clean it by using a dry cloth 
to wipe all dust and other accumulations 
away from its prongs. Also, disconnect the 
power plug from the power outlet whenever 
the unit is to remain unused for an extended 
period of time. Any accumulation of dust 
between the power plug and the power 
outlet can result in poor insulation and lead 
to fire.
................................................................................................
 
104
 
• Try to prevent cords and cables from 
becoming entangled. Also, all cords and 
cables should be placed so they are out of the 
reach of children.
................................................................................................
 
106
 
• Never climb on top of, nor place heavy 
objects on the unit.
................................................................................................
 
107d
 
• Never handle the AC adaptor body, or its 
output plugs, with wet hands when plugging 
into, or unplugging from, an outlet or this 
unit.
................................................................................................
 
108b
 
• Before moving the unit, disconnect the AC 
adaptor and all cords coming from external 
devices.
................................................................................................
 
109b
 
• Before cleaning the unit, turn off the power 
and unplug the AC adaptor from the outlet 
(p. 21).
................................................................................................
 
110b
 
• Whenever you suspect the possibility of 
lightning in your area, disconnect the AC 
adaptor from the outlet.
................................................................................................
 
118c
 
• Keep any screws you may remove and the 
included card theft prevention cover in a safe 
place out of children’s reach, so there is no 
chance of them being swallowed accidentally.

In addition to the items listed under “USING THE 
UNIT SAFELY” on page 2–3, please read and 
observe the following:
 
Power Supply
 
301
 
• Do not connect this unit to same electrical outlet that 
is being used by an electrical appliance that is 
controlled by an inverter (such as a refrigerator, 
washing machine, microwave oven, or air condi-
tioner), or that contains a motor. Depending on the 
way in which the electrical appliance is used, power 
supply noise may cause this unit to malfunction or 
may produce audible noise. If it is not practical to 
use a separate electrical outlet, connect a power 
supply noise filter between this unit and the 
electrical outlet.
 
302
 
• The AC adaptor will begin to generate heat after 
long hours of consecutive use. This is normal, and is 
not a cause for concern.
 
307
 
• Before connecting this unit to other devices, turn off 
the power to all units. This will help prevent 
malfunctions and/or damage to speakers or other 
devices.
 
Placement
 
351
 
• Using the unit near power amplifiers (or other 
equipment containing large power transformers) 
may induce hum. To alleviate the problem, change 
the orientation of this unit; or move it farther away 
from the source of interference.
 
352a
 
• This device may interfere with radio and television 
reception. Do not use this device in the vicinity of 
such receivers.
 
352b
 
• Noise may be produced if wireless communications 
devices, such as cell phones, are operated in the 
vicinity of this unit. Such noise could occur when 
receiving or initiating a call, or while conversing. 
Should you experience such problems, you should 
relocate such wireless devices so they are at a greater 
distance from this unit, or switch them off.
 
354a
 
• Do not expose the unit to direct sunlight, place it 
near devices that radiate heat, leave it inside an 
enclosed vehicle, or otherwise subject it to temper-
ature extremes. Excessive heat can deform or 
discolor the unit.
 
355b
 
• When moved from one location to another where 
the temperature and/or humidity is very different, 
water droplets (condensation) may form inside the 
unit. Damage or malfunction may result if you 
attempt to use the unit in this condition. Therefore, 
before using the unit, you must allow it to stand for 
several hours, until the condensation has completely 
evaporated.
 
Maintenance
 
401a
 
• For everyday cleaning wipe the unit with a soft, dry 
cloth or one that has been slightly dampened with 
water. To remove stubborn dirt, use a cloth impreg-
nated with a mild, non-abrasive detergent. After-
wards, be sure to wipe the unit thoroughly with a 
soft, dry cloth.
 
402
 
• Never use benzine, thinners, alcohol or solvents of 
any kind, to avoid the possibility of discoloration 
and/or deformation.
 
Repairs and Data
 
452
 
• Please be aware that all data contained in the unit’s 
memory may be lost when the unit is sent for 
repairs. Important data should always be backed up 
on a memory card, or written down on paper (when 
possible). During repairs, due care is taken to avoid 
the loss of data. However, in certain cases (such as 
when circuitry related to memory itself is out of 
order), we regret that it may not be possible to 
restore the data, and Roland assumes no liability 
concerning such loss of data.
 
Additional Precautions
 
551
 
• Please be aware that the contents of memory can be 
irretrievably lost as a result of a malfunction, or the 
improper operation of the unit. To protect yourself 
against the risk of loosing important data, we 
recommend that you periodically save a backup 
copy of important data you have stored in the unit’s 
memory on a memory card.
 
552
 
• Unfortunately, it may be impossible to restore the 
contents of data that was stored on a memory card 
once it has been lost. Roland Corporation assumes 
no liability concerning such loss of data.

553
 
• Use a reasonable amount of care when using the 
unit’s buttons, sliders, or other controls; and when 
using its jacks and connectors. Rough handling can 
lead to malfunctions.
 
554
 
• Never strike or apply strong pressure to the display.
 
555
 
•A small amount of noise may be heard from the 
display during normal operation.
 
556
 
• When connecting / disconnecting all cables, grasp 
the connector itself—never pull on the cable. This 
way you will avoid causing shorts, or damage to the 
cable’s internal elements.
 
558a
 
• To avoid disturbing your neighbors, try to keep the 
unit’s volume at reasonable levels. You may prefer 
to use headphones, so you do not need to be 
concerned about those around you (especially when 
it is late at night).
 
559a
 
• When you need to transport the unit, package it in 
the box (including padding) that it came in, if 
possible. Otherwise, you will need to use equivalent 
packaging materials.
 
562
 
• Use a cable from Roland to make the connection. If 
using some other make of connection cable, please 
note the following precautions.
• Some connection cables contain resistors. Do not 
use cables that incorporate resistors for 
connecting to this unit. The use of such cables can 
cause the sound level to be extremely low, or 
impossible to hear. For information on cable 
specifications, contact the manufacturer of the 
cable.
 
563
 
• Unauthorized duplication, reproduction, hiring, and 
lending prohibited.
 
564
 
• Before you open the included CD-ROM, you must 
read the “license agreement.” Opening the CD-ROM 
will be taken to mean your acceptance of the license 
agreement.
 
566b
 
• The sensitivity of the D Beam controller will change 
depending on the amount of light in the vicinity of 
the unit. If it does not function as you expect, adjust 
the sensitivity as appropriate for the brightness of 
your location.
 
985
 
• The explanations in this manual include illustrations 
that depict what should typically be shown by the 
display. Note, however, that your unit may incor-
porate a newer, enhanced version of the system (e.g., 
includes newer sounds), so what you actually see in 
the display may not always match what appears in 
the manual.
 
Before Using Cards
 
Using DATA Cards
 
704
 
• Carefully insert the DATA card all the way in—until 
it is firmly in place.
 
705
 
• Never touch the terminals of the DATA card. Also, 
avoid getting the terminals dirty.
 
707
 
• This unit’s memory card slot accepts CompactFlash 
memory cards. Microdrive storage media are not 
compatible.
 
708
 
• Memory cards are constructed using precision 
components; handle the cards carefully, paying 
particular note to the following.
• To prevent damage to the cards from static 
electricity, be sure to discharge any static 
electricity from your own body before handling 
the cards.
• Do not touch or allow metal to come into contact 
with the contact portion of the cards.
• Do not bend, drop, or subject cards to strong 
shock or vibration.
• Do not keep cards in direct sunlight, in closed 
vehicles, or other such locations (storage temper-
ature: -25 to 85° C).
• Do not allow cards to become wet.
• Do not disassemble or modify the cards.
 
Handling CD-ROMs
 
801
 
• Avoid touching or scratching the shiny underside 
(encoded surface) of the disc. Damaged or dirty CD-
ROM discs may not be read properly. Keep your 
discs clean using a commercially available CD 
cleaner.

Main Features
 
Quick and easy sampling (p. 26, p. 42)
 
The SP-606 lets you use any of three sampling modes, whichever is most convenient for your situation. 
 
EXT SEQ 
SAMPLING
 
 makes it easy to capture a loop phrase of the appropriate length from an external MIDI device. With 
no need for settings or editing, sampling is quick and easy.
 
Sample from a variety of sources (p. 12, p. 84)
 
You can sample audio sources from the analog or digital inputs, or even via the USB connection, giving you the 
flexibility to use any type of source.
 
Use the Chop function to automatically divide phrases (p. 53)
 
The SP-606 provides a Chop function, which automatically divides an audio phrase into several one-shot samples. 
The divided samples can be rearranged randomly, combined, or used to create a virtually infinite number of 
variations.
 
Velocity-sensitive pads are ideal for creating grooves (p. 23, p. 30)
 
The sixteen velocity-sensitive pads are a superb way to program grooves with natural-sounding dynamics, and 
also offer great potential for realtime performance.
In addition, pad 16 can operate as a 
 
Sub Pad
 
, which remembers and plays the same sound as the previously 
played pad. This gives you much more freedom for performance expression, such as letting you use both hands to 
play rolls or repeated notes.
 
Four-track pattern sequencer (p. 54)
 
In addition to realtime input, you can use two different step-input methods: the standard “
 
Step Rec Note
 
,” in 
which you specify each note for input; and “
 
Step Rec Smpl
 
,” in which the length of the sample you input 
determines the timing of the next sample. These input methods accommodate a wide range of track-making 
situations.
 
BPM (tempo) sync capability (p. 52)
 
Any phrase sample can be freely made to follow the tempo of the internal sequencer. Since you can adjust the 
BPM in real time without affecting the pitch, you can use samples in a whole new variety of ways.
 
Two independent multi-effects processors (p. 33)
 
Forty-five types
 
 of multi-effects range from familiar standards, such as spatial effects and distortion-type effects, 
and also include unique effects such as “
 
TAPE ECHO
 
” and “
 
LO-FI PROCESSOR
 
.” Any of these effects can be 
used by either of the two multi-effects modules connected in series, giving you enormous potential for creative 
sound-making. Intuitive knob-based control makes it easy to create bold and smooth changes in the sound.
 
Mastering effects for adding the finishing touch (p. 33)
 
Separately from the two multi-effects modules, a mastering effect module is provided to let you add finishing 
touches at the final stage of your song, bringing it into a professional level of sound quality.
 
D Beam controller and V-LINK functionality (p. 72, p. 75)
 
The SP-606 features a D Beam controller, which lets you control a filter or solo synthesizer simply by moving your 
hand. New realms of expression are made possible by V-LINK functionality, which lets you connect a compatible 
video device and control it to create video effects that are linked to the expressive elements of a musical 
performance.

Main Features
 
Use memory cards for easy expansion (p. 67)
 
A memory card slot is provided on the front panel. By inserting a commercially available 512 MB CompactFlash 
card, you can perform up to 386 minutes of sampling (LONG mode, mono). There’s no need to load the data into 
internal memory—data on the card can be accessed directly, even for playing from the pads. Even extremely large 
samples can be handled quickly and freely.
 
USB connection to your computer (p. 83)
 
The SP-606 provides not only USB-MIDI functionality, but also file transfer capability for importing and exporting 
.WAV and AIFF files. Audio drivers for WDM and ASIO are included, letting the SP-606 function as a versatile 
USB audio interface (on Windows or Macintosh) with a variety of inputs and outputs.
 
Dedicated “P606” software for unlimited creation of loops (p. 86)
 
• The dedicated P606 software application developed by Cakewalk Corporation is included. P606 
consists of three different sound generator modules, sophisticated multi-effects, and a sixteen-part 
pattern sequencer and mixer—in other words, it’s a virtual groovebox!
• Phrases you create using P606 can be captured into the USB-connected SP-606 easily and quickly via 
 
EXT SEQ SAMPLING
 
. The SP-606 automatically obtains the BPM (tempo), time signature, and 
number of measures of the phrase, and makes the appropriate loop settings, meaning that you won’t 
have to perform any bothersome processes after sampling.
• Of course the SP-606 also functions as a control surface for P606.

Sampler
 
This records (samples) sounds, such as musical 
performances or vocals, and plays back these 
sounds.
 
Effects
 
This section applies various effects to the sampled 
sounds (samples). You can choose from forty-five 
different types of effect, such as “reverb” which 
adds reverberation, and “lo-fi processor” which 
intentionally degrades the audio quality of the 
sound.
 
Pads
 
You can strike these pads to play the samples. You 
can also vary the loudness of the sound by the 
strength with which you strike a pad.
 
Sequencer
 
This section lets you record the timing at which you 
want samples to play, and specify how the samples 
will be played. You can then play back this data to 
create automatic performances.

An Overview of the SP-606
 
The SP-606 uses four types of data: “
 
samples
 
” and “
 
pad banks
 
,” which contain sounds; and “
 
patterns
 
” and 
“
 
songs
 
,” which contain performance data. In addition the SP-606 operates in one of two modes: “
 
internal mode
 
” 
in which you use the SP-606’s pads and knobs to control the SP-606 itself; and “
 
external mode
 
,” in which the pads 
and knobs control the included P606 application running on your computer.
 
What Are Samples?
 
A sample is the most basic unit of audio material, consisting of a waveform (wave) that was created by sampling a 
performance, instrumental sound, or voice, together with settings that specify how this waveform will be played 
back. You can play the samples that are assigned to the pads, or play them from the internal sequencer or an 
external sequencer.
There are two types of samples, which differ in the way that they are played back: phrase samples and single 
samples.
 
Phrase Samples
 
In general, samples created by sampling a performance are called Phrase samples.
To use a sample as a phrase sample on the SP-606, set the sample’s “Play Type” (p. 50) parameter to 
 
PHRASE
 
. 
This causes the sample BPM (tempo) to automatically match the playback BPM or sequencer BPM.
This setting is appropriate for phrases that are one or several measures long.
 
fig.0G-2
 
The sample BPM can be varied within the range from 0.5 through 1.3. If the sequencer BPM would 
cause the sample BPM to exceed this allowable range, the sample BPM will be doubled or halved so 
that it stays within this range.
 
Single Samples
 
On the SP-606, short samples (such as individual notes) are called Single samples. To use a sample as a single 
sample, set its “Play Type” (p. 50) parameter to 
 
SINGLE
 
. This causes the sample to always play at its original 
length.
This setting is suitable for sounds that you use as single notes, such as drum hits or sound effects.

An Overview of the SP-606
 
What Are Pad Banks?
 
A group of sixteen samples assigned to the pads of the top panel are collectively called a Pad Bank.
The SP-606 has thirty-two pad banks, letting you use a total of 512 samples.
Refer to “Switching Pad Banks” (p. 23).
 
About Pad Banks 1–8
 
When you sample into these banks, the samples will be saved in internal memory.
When the SP-606 is shipped from the factory, samples are already loaded into pad banks 1–4. Since 
these samples are protected so that they will not be erased accidentally, you will be unable to edit or 
delete them. If you want to disable protection for these samples, disable the pad bank protect setting 
(p. 31).
 
About Pad Banks 9–32
 
When you sample into these banks, the samples will be saved on a memory card.
 
What Are Patterns?
 
A pattern consists of 1–32 measures of performance (sequence) data that specifies the timing at which samples 
will be played. Each pattern contain four “parts” (tracks), in which separate performances can be recorded.
You can select and play different patterns in succession, or create a song by specifying the order in which you 
want patterns to play.
 
fig.0G-4
 
A pattern can be up to 32 measures long.
The pattern simply specifies the timing at which the samples play; it does not contain the samples 
themselves. This means that if you change the sample, the playback result will also change.
 
What Is a Song?
 
On the SP-606, an arrangement of multiple patterns in a desired playback order is called a Song.
 
fig.0G-5
 
The song simply specifies the order in which patterns will play; it does not contain the sequence 
data of the patterns themselves. This means that if you edit a pattern, the song playback will be 
affected.

2. Ground terminal
 
Depending on the circumstances of a particular setup, 
you may experience a discomforting sensation, or 
perceive that the surface feels gritty to the touch when 
you touch this device, microphones connected to it, or the 
metal portions of other objects. This is due to an 
infinitesimal electrical charge, which is absolutely 
harmless. However, if you are concerned about this, 
connect the ground terminal (see figure) with an external 
ground. When the unit is grounded, a slight hum may 
occur, depending on the particulars of your installation. 
If you are unsure of the connection method, contact the 
nearest Roland Service Center, or an authorized Roland 
distributor, as listed on the “Information” page.
Unsuitable places for connection

Connecting the SP-606 to Your 
Equipment
 
For details on USB connections, refer to “Chapter 13. About USB” (p. 83).
 
fig.connects
 
Refer to the diagram, and make connections according to the following procedure.
 
1.
 
Before you make any connections, switch off the power on all your equipment.
 
To prevent malfunction and/or damage to speakers or other devices, always turn down the volume, 
and turn off the power on all devices before making any connections.
 
2.
 
Connect the included AC adaptor to the AC adaptor jack.
 
To prevent the inadvertent disruption of power to your unit (should the plug be pulled out 
accidentally), and to avoid applying undue stress to the AC adaptor jack, anchor the power cord 
using the cord hook, as shown in the illustration.
 
3.
 
Connect your audio system or amp(s) to the OUTPUT or DIGITAL OUT jacks. If you’re using headphones, 
connect them to the PHONES jack.
 
If you intend to sample (p. 26, p. 42), connect your audio source device (e.g., CD player or mic) to the 
 
INPUT
 
 or 
 
DIGITAL IN
 
 jacks.
 
4.
 
Plug the AC adaptor into an AC outlet.

When connection cables with resistors are used, the volume level of equipment connected to the 
inputs (INPUT, DIGITAL IN) may be low. If this happens, use connection cables that do not contain 
resistors, such as those from the Roland PCS series.
Howling could be produced depending on the location of microphones relative to speakers. This can 
be remedied by:
1. Changing the orientation of the microphone(s).
2. Relocating microphone(s) at a greater distance from speakers.
3. Lowering volume levels.

at which you pressed the button (Tap Tempo function).
You cannot change the BPM if “Sync Mode” (p. 79) is set to SLAVE.
 
4.
 
Press [EXIT] to return to the Play screen.
 
You can mute (silence) specific tracks while a pattern plays.
 
1.
 
Go to the Pattern Play screen (p. 15).
 
2.
 
Press [ ] (Play) to play the pattern.
 
3.
 
Press TRACK [1]–[4].
 
Button lit: playing
Button blinking: muted
If a track button is unlit, that track contains no data.
The mute status of each track can be stored with the pattern. (p. 59)
Including the playback of the song/pattern and the sounds you play from the pads, a maximum of eight notes 
can be played simultaneously. Each stereo sample uses two notes.
If you attempt to play more than eight notes simultaneously, the samples you most recently played from the pads 
will take priority, and the sample played by a previously pressed pad will stop sounding. Samples whose “Play 
Type” (p. 50) is set to PHRASE will take priority over SINGLE samples.
The SP-606’s [INPUT SOURCE] pad lets you start/stop the sound of an external audio input source in the same 
way as when controlling a sample. You can also apply effects to this sound.
In the explanation below, we will use a connected CD player as an example.
 
1.
 
Make sure that the SP-606 and your CD player are powered off.
 
2.
 
On the top panel, turn the AUDIO IN REC LEVEL knob to the minimum position (far left).
 
3.
 
Connect your CD player to the rear panel INPUT L/R or DIGITAL IN jack (p. 20).
 
To prevent malfunction and/or damage to speakers or other devices, always turn down the volume, 
and turn off the power on all devices before making any connections.

SHOT
 
: The sample will begin playing when you press the pad, and will 
stop automatically when the end of the sample is reached.
If you select the SHOT setting, the Loop setting (p. 28) 
is ignored; the sample will play only once. Note that if you select SHOT, you will not be able 
to interrupt the sound, so use this setting with caution if the sample is extremely long.
 
ALTERNATE
 
: The sample will begin playing when you press the pad, and will continue playing even after you 
release the pad. It will stop when you press the pad once again.
 
GATE
 
: The sample will begin playing when you press the pad, and will stop playing when you release the pad.

Chapter 1. Playing the Pads/Making 
Pad Settings
 
For details on basic ways to play the pads, refer to “Playing Samples from the Pads” in the Quick 
Start (p. 23).
Here’s how you can make a sample play repeatedly (i.e., “roll”) as long as you hold down a pad.
 
1.
 
Go to the Play screen (p. 15).
 
2.
 
Press [ROLL] so the button is lit; this enables the Roll function.
 
3.
 
Hold down a pad, and the roll will begin.
 
You can play a roll by pressing any pad [1]–[16], or by pressing multiple pads simultaneously.
You can specify the resolution of the roll. Refer to “Basic Procedure for Pad Utility Settings” (p. 31) 
and “Pad Utility Parameters” (p. 31).
 
4.
 
When you release the pad, the roll will stop.
 
5.
 
To turn off the Roll function, press [ROLL] so its illumination is turned off.
 
You can use the Sub Pad to play the sample of the pad you struck most recently. This is a convenient way to play 
a drum roll manually.
 
1.
 
Go to the Play screen (p. 15).
 
2.
 
Hold down [FUNC] and press pad [9] (PAD UTIL) to get the PAD 
UTILITY screen.
 
3.
 
Press [ ] to move the cursor to the “Sub Pad Sw” line.
 
4.
 
Turn the VALUE dial or use [DEC][INC] to turn the setting ON.
 
Pad [16] will light green, and will now operate as the Sub Pad.
This does not erase the sample of pad [16]; its original 
sample will reappear when you turn off the Sub Pad setting.
 
5.
 
When you press pad [16], the sample of the most recently struck pad will sound.
 
6.
 
If you turn the “Sub Pad Sw” OFF, pad [16] will go dark, and the Sub Pad function will be disabled.
 
The Hold function makes a sample continue sounding even after you take your finger off the pad. This is 
convenient when you want a phrase loop sample to continue playing.
However, you cannot exceed the maximum polyphony of eight notes even when using the Hold function.
Hold applies only to samples for which GATE playback (p. 50) is specified. Hold does not apply to 
samples for which ALTERNATE playback or SHOT playback (p. 50) is specified, nor to the Roll 
function (p. 30).
 
1.
 
Go to the Play screen (p. 15).
 
2.
 
Press a pad to play its sample.

the pad.
 
4.
 
The sound will stop when you press the currently sounding pad or the [HOLD] pad once again.
 
When you press the [HOLD] pad again, all currently held sounds will stop.
You can protect a pad bank so that it cannot be edited or erased.
When the SP-606 is shipped from the factory, you will not be able to edit or erase pad banks 1–4 
since they are protected to prevent the samples from being deleted accidentally.

At the point where you want to stop sampling, press [SAMPLING] or [F3] (STOP).
 
Sampling will stop automatically if you exceed the available sampling time.
 
8.
 
Press the pad to play the sampled sound.
 
When sampling ends, the BPM (tempo) is automatically calculated from the length of the sample. 
You can use the BPM Sync function (p. 52) to change this BPM setting.
If the beginning or end of the sample contains unwanted sound or silence, you can make settings so 
that only the desired portion is played. For details, refer to “Specifying the Start/End Points of a 
Sample (Omitting Unwanted Portions)” (p. 51).
If you want to delete a sampled sound, refer to “Deleting a Sample” (p. 32).
“Resampling” is the process of playing back one or more existing samples and re-recording (re-
sampling) the result.
On the SP-606, you can resample only samples within the same pad bank.
You cannot resample using the Roll function (p. 30).
You cannot use the D Beam during resampling.
Note messages from an external MIDI device are not received during resampling.
If you want to apply an effect while resampling, press [MFX1], [MFX2], or [MASTERING] so the button is lit.
For details on effects, refer to “Chapter 2. Using Effects” (p. 33).

Chapter 5. Creating a Pattern
 
You can create original patterns by recording your performance on the pads.
A pattern can be recorded in either of the following two ways.
 
Realtime Recording
 
In this method you strike the pads to record them while the pattern plays. The pattern will continue repeating, 
and the data you input (i.e., your pad strikes) will be added to the pattern.
Even if your timing is not perfect, you can use the Quantize function to tighten up the timing. You can also input 
from an external MIDI device as well as from the pads.
 
Step Recording
 
In this method you input notes one by one, in “non-realtime.”
 
1.
 
Go to the Pattern Play screen (p. 15).
 
2.
 
Press [ ] (Record) to get the RECORDING MENU screen.
 
[] (Record) will blink.
 
3.
 
Press [F1] (REALTM) to get the REALTIME REC STANDBY (Realtime 
Recording Standby) screen.
 
Alternatively, you can get the same result from the screen 
of step 2 by moving the cursor to “Realtime Rec” and pressing [ENTER] or [ ] (Play).
 
4.
 
Press TRACK [1]–[4] to select the track on which you intend to record.
 
The button you press will blink, and the track number will appear in the upper left of the screen.
You can also change tracks while recording.
 
5.
 
Use [ ][ ] to select the parameter you want to set.
 
Turn the VALUE dial or use [DEC][INC] to set the parameter value.
You can use a slower tempo for easy input, and then revert to the desired tempo after you’ve 
recorded the data.
If you decide to discontinue, press [EXIT].

Chapter 8. Using a Memory Card
 
If the SP-606 is powered up, do not remove the memory card from the SP-606’s card slot before 
shutting down (p. 22). Doing so may damage the SP-606 or the data in the memory card.
Make sure that the memory card is oriented correctly, and insert it all the way into the slot. Do not 
use excessive force.
When using a memory card for the first time, you must format it on the SP-606. Memory cards 
formatted by another device will not be recognized by the SP-606.
For more about inserting and removing memory cards, refer to “Inserting/Removing Memory 
Cards” (p. 22).
For details on the recommended memory cards, refer to “Recommended Memory Cards” (p. 91) in

Card Utility Operations
 
FILE IMPORT
Caution When Importing Audio Files (WAV/AIFF)
• When using your computer or other device to copy or save an audio file (WAV/AIFF) onto a 
memory card, place the file in the root directory (the top level) of the card. If you place the file 
anywhere else on the card, the SP-606 will be unable to import it.
• When importing, the SP-606 can recognize a maximum of 200 audio files.
• File names that are longer than eight characters or that contain double-byte (e.g., Japanese) 
characters will not be displayed correctly.
• WAV files must have a filename extension of WAV, and AIFF files must have a filename extension 
of AIF. Files will not be recognized if they have any other extension.
• The SP-606 can only import 8-bit or 16-bit samples.
• Sample rate conversion is not performed. The audio file will be imported as 44.1 kHz data. If the 
actual sample rate of the imported file is other than 44.1 kHz, it will play at an incorrect pitch.
• The loop point settings within an AIFF file are ignored.
• If you attempt to import WAV/AIFF data in a format not supported by the SP-606, the error 
message “unsupported!” will appear, and the data will not be imported.
• Compressed audio files (WAV/AIFF) cannot be imported.
• In some cases, it may not be possible to import extremely short audio files (WAV/AIFF).
• The following table shows the time required to import large audio files.
* Once the Import operation has begun, it cannot be canceled.
File size Audio playback time Time required for import
1 MB Approx. 10 seconds of stereo Approx. 30 seconds
10 MB Approx. 2 minutes of stereo Approx. 5 minutes
50 MB Approx. 10 minutes of stereo Approx. 25 minutes

Chapter 10. About V-LINK
 
V-LINK (   ) is functionality promoted by Roland that allows linked performance of music and 
visual material. By using V-LINK-compatible video equipment (such as the Edirol DV-7PR or P-1), visual effects 
can be easily linked to, and made part of the expressive elements of a performance.
For example, when the SP-606 is used in conjunction with the Edirol P-1, applications such as the following are 
made possible:
• Use the SP-606’s sequencer to play music and show images in synchronization.
• Use the SP-606’s pads or sequencer playback (song or pattern) to switch photos or pages on the Edirol P-1.
In order to use V-LINK between the SP-606 and the Edirol P-1, you will need to connect the two 
units using a MIDI cable (sold separately).
Use a MIDI cable to connect the SP-606’s MIDI OUT connector to the MIDI IN connector of the Edirol P-1.
To prevent malfunction and/or speaker damage, you must turn down the volume on all devices 
and turn off their power before making connections.
 
1.
 
Go to the Play screen (p. 15).
 
2.
 
Press [V-LINK] so it’s lit.
 
The 
 
V-LINK
 
 screen will appear.
In this state, you can operate the SP-606’s pads or knobs to control images 
in conjunction with the SP-606’s performance.
When you press [F1] (RESET), the display will indicate “Send All Reset”; 
the effects being applied to the image will be reset, and settings such as 
brightness and hue will all return to their default settings.
When you press [F2] (MODE), you can select whether the pads will 
switch 
 
PALETTES
 
 or 
 
CLIPS
 
.
When you press [F3] (SETUP), the 
 
V-LINK SETUP
 
 screen will appear (p. 76).
 
3.
 
Press [EXIT].
 
The V-LINK function will remain on, and you will return to the Play screen.
 
4.
 
When you are ready to turn off the V-LINK function, press [V-LINK] so its illumination is turned off.
 
If you returned to the Play screen in step 3, press [V-LINK] to return to the V-LINK screen and then press [V-
LINK] once again so its illumination is turned off.
The V-LINK function will always be off when you turn on the power.

Chapter 11. Using the SP-606 with 
Other MIDI Equipment
 
Do not use a MIDI cable to connect the SP-606’s MIDI IN connector directly to its MIDI OUT 
connector (i.e., in a loop). Also, if you make connections with other MIDI equipment in a way that 
forms a loop, do not set your other MIDI device to “thru” (“software thru”) the incoming data. The 
SP-606 may not operate correctly if you fail to observe these points.
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is a universal standard that allows electronic musical 
instruments, computers, and similar devices to exchange performance data and other musical information. The 
SP-606 is MIDI-compatible, and provides two MIDI connectors; MIDI IN and MIDI OUT. By using these 
connectors to connect the SP-606 to other devices, you can take advantage of a wide range of possibilities.
The SP-606 has two types of MIDI connector.
 
MIDI IN
 
: Receives MIDI messages from another MIDI device.
 
MIDI OUT
 
: Transmits MIDI messages from the SP-606.
The MIDI implementation chart (p. 96) provides an easy way to see just what MIDI messages the SP-606 is able to 
transmit and receive. By placing this chart beside the MIDI implementation chart of another MIDI device, you can 
see at a glance which MIDI messages can be sent and received between the two devices.
If you’re using an external MIDI device to play the SP-606’s pads, transmit the following note numbers.
If you want to change the MIDI channel, edit the “Pad Base Ch” setting (p. 79).

Troubleshooting
 
This section provides points to check and actions to take when 
the SP-606 does not function as you expect. Refer to the 
appropriate section for the problem you are experiencing.
If you find the screen display difficult or impossible to read, 
hold down [
 
KNOB ASSIGN
 
] and turn the 
 
VALUE
 
 dial to 
adjust the contrast.
 
No Sound/Insufficient Volume
 
Is the SP-606 correctly connected to your external 
equipment?
 
Check the connections. (p. 20)
 
Could your audio cables be broken?
Could you be using a cable with a built-in resistor?
 
Use connection cables that do not have built-in resistors (such 
as the Roland PCS series).
 
Could the volume be lowered on the connected amp 
or mixer?
 
Adjust the volume to an appropriate level.
 
Could the volume of the SP-606 be too low?
 
Adjust the volume to an appropriate level.
 
Is there sound from the headphones?
 
If you hear sound from the headphones, the problem lies in a 
broken cable or in the amp or mixer that is connected. Check 
the connections and the connected devices. (p. 20)
 
In the MASTER screen, could “In Level,” “Low Gain,” 
or “High Gain” be lowered?
 
Adjust the various levels in the 
 
MASTERING
 
 screen 
appropriately. (p. 34)
 
Is the SP-606 in External mode?
 
Samples will not sound in External mode. (p. 15)
 
Specific Pads Do Not Sound
 
Could the level of the sample be lowered?
 
Adjust the level of the sample. (p. 50)
 
Try turning off the MFX1 and MFX2 switches.
 
If you now hear sound, it may be that the level was being 
constrained by the MFX parameters, or that the MFX type was 
set to “
 
ENVELOPER (PAD)
 
.” Adjust the parameters to 
appropriate settings. If the MFX type is “
 
ENVELOPER 
(PAD)
 
,” striking a pad will apply an envelope so that the 
sound will be heard.
 
The Sound Stops Unexpectedly
 
Could a Mute Group be specified?
 
Turn off the Mute Group. (p. 50)
 
Could “Trig Mode” be set to ALTERNATE?
 
If “Trig Mode” is set to 
 
ALTERNATE
 
, the sample will 
alternately play or stop each time you strike the pad. If you 
want the sample to sound each time you strike the pad, set 
“Trig Mode” to 
 
GATE
 
 or 
 
SHOT
 
. (p. 50)
 
The Sound Does Not Stop
 
Could “Trig Mode” be set to SHOT?
 
If “Trig Mode” is set to 
 
SHOT
 
, the sample will play all the way 
to its end, so that for a long sample it may seem that the sound 
does not stop. If you set “Trig Mode” to 
 
ALTERNATE
 
, the 
sample will alternately play or stop each time you strike the 
pad. Or, if you set “Trig Mode” to 
 
GATE
 
, the sample will 
continue playing only as long as you hold down the pad. (p. 
50)
 
Could the Loop setting of the sample be turned on?
 
Turn looping off. (p. 50)
 
Can’t Control the Volume by Varying 
Your Striking Force on the Pads
 
Could “Pad Velocity” be set to a fixed setting?
 
If you want to control the volume by varying your striking 
force on the pads, you must set “Pad Velocity” to 
 
REAL
 
. (p. 
31)

Troubleshooting
 
No Sound from a Device Connected to 
LINE IN
 
Is the [INPUT SOURCE] pad lit?
 
If you want to output sound from an external input source, 
press the [
 
INPUT SOURCE
 
] pad so it is lit. (p. 25)
 
Is “Input Select” set to LINE?
 
In the 
 
INPUT SETTING
 
 screen, set “Input Select” to 
 
LINE
 
. (p. 
43)
 
Could the AUDIO IN REC LEVEL be lowered?
 
Adjust the 
 
AUDIO IN REC LEVEL
 
 knob until the level is 
appropriate. (p. 44)
 
Could the level of the connected device be lowered?
 
Adjust the volume appropriately.
 
Could you be using a cable with a built-in resistor?
 
Use connection cables that do not have built-in resistors (such 
as the Roland PCS series).
 
No Sound from a Device Connected to 
DIGITAL IN
 
Is the [INPUT SOURCE] pad lit?
 
If you want to output sound from an external input source, 
press the [
 
INPUT SOURCE
 
] pad so it is lit. (p. 25)
 
Has the correct setting been made in the INPUT 
SETTING screen?
 
In the 
 
INPUT SETTING
 
 screen, set “Input Select” to 
 
DIGITAL
 
, 
and adjust the “Digital In Level” appropriately. (p. 43)
 
Could the level of the connected device be lowered?
 
Adjust the volume appropriately.
 
No Sound from Your Computer
 
Make the correct “USB Audio/MIDI” settings. (p. 84)
 
No Sound from the Mic/Insufficient 
Volume
 
Is the [INPUT SOURCE] pad lit?
 
If you want to output sound from an external input source, 
press the [
 
INPUT SOURCE
 
] pad so it is lit. (p. 25)
 
Is “Input Select” set to MIC?
 
In the 
 
INPUT SETTING
 
 screen, set “Input Select” to 
 
MIC
 
. (p. 
43)
 
Could the AUDIO IN REC LEVEL be lowered?
 
Adjust the 
 
AUDIO IN REC LEVEL
 
 knob until the level is 
appropriate. (p. 44)
 
Can’t Sample
 
If you’re sampling to a memory card, has the 
memory card been formatted by the SP-606?
 
Format the memory card on the SP-606. (p. 67)
 
Sampled Sound Contains Noise or 
Distortion
 
Is the input level appropriate?
 
If the input level is too high, the sampled sound will be 
distorted. If the input level is too low, the sampled sound will 
contain obtrusive noise. Watch the level meter displayed in 
the screen, and adjust the 
 
AUDIO IN REC LEVEL
 
 knob 
appropriately. (p. 44)
 
Data Was Not Saved Correctly
 
It is possible that you didn’t turn off the power 
correctly.
 
In particular, if you turn off the power while the display still 
indicates “Processing ...,” not only will the data not be saved 
correctly, but other data may also be damaged. The damaged 
data cannot be recovered. Always be sure to turn off the 
power using the correct procedure. (p. 21)
 
Can’t Select Data from a Memory 
Card
 
Is the memory card inserted correctly?
 
Shut down the SP-606, remove the memory card, and reinsert 
it all the way into the slot. (p. 22)
 
Is the memory card of the correct type?
 
The SP-606 can use CompactFlash cards with a capacity of 
from 16 MB through 512 MB (3.3V). No other types of cards 
can be used.
 
Memory-Related Problems
SP-606_e.book 88 ページ ２００４年６月２１日　月曜日　午前１０時８分

--- Page 89 ---
89
 
Troubleshooting
 
Was the memory card formatted correctly?
 
Only memory cards that were formatted by the SP-606 can be 
used. Format the memory card on the SP-606. (p. 67)
 
Doesn’t Play When You Press [ ] 
(Play)
 
Have you selected a pattern or song that contains 
data?
 
A pattern or song containing no data has no measures, and 
therefore playback cannot take place. Record the pattern or 
song before you play it (p. 54, p. 63).
 
After Recording, There’s No Sound 
When You Play Back the Song or 
Pattern
 
Could the tracks be muted?
 
Un-mute the tracks. (p. 25, p. 59, p. 66)
 
Is the Sync Mode set correctly?
 
If the Sync Mode is set to Slave, playback will not progress 
unless Clock messages are being received from the external 
MIDI device. Also, make sure that the clock transmission 
source matches the Sync Source (p. 79).
 
Playback Lags or Is Interrupted
 
This can occur if a heavy processing load is being placed on 
the sequence playback or sample playback. The most likely 
reasons and the appropriate actions to take are as follows.
 
Could more than eight notes be playing 
simultaneously?
 
Try decreasing the number of notes.
 
Could a large amount of data be concentrated at the 
beginning of the beats in a pattern?
 
If you used step-recording to input data, or if you applied 
quantization to realtime recording, it is easy for data to 
become concentrated at the beginning of the beats in a pattern. 
Using 
 
MICROSCOPE
 
, try shifting data located at the same 
time so that the data is separated by one or two clocks.
 
Samples Don’t Sound
 
Is the cable connected correctly?
 
Check the MIDI or USB cable connection.
 
Are you transmitting the correct note for the 
sample?
 
In order to play a sample from an external device, you must 
transmit the appropriate note number on the appropriate 
channel.
For the correspondence between samples and note numbers, 
refer to “MIDI on the SP-606.” (p. 78)

Addresses Transmitted by Panel Operations
 
The following addresses are transmitted when you operate the panel in EXT mode.
(
 
*1
 
): This is transmitted when you press a pad (it is not transmitted when you
release the pad). It is not transmitted for NOTE TRIG.
 
■
 
Other Addresses Received
 
For addresses marked by #, the data is divided into multiple pieces for reception.
Example: for Beat = 32
32 is expressed in hexadecimal as 020H. 020H is divided as [00H 02H 00H].

Calculation of the Checksum of Exclusive 
Messages
 
Roland Exclusive messages (RQ1, DT1) are transmitted with a checksum at the end
(before F7) to make sure that the message was correctly received.
The value of the checksum is determined by the address and data (or size) of the
transmitted exclusive message.
 
❍
 
How to calculate the checksum (hexadecimal numbers are
indicated by “H”)
 
The checksum is a value derived by adding the address, size and checksum itself
and inverting the lower 7 bits.
Here’s an example of how the checksum is calculated.
We will assume that in the exclusive message we are transmitting, the address is aa
bb cc ddH and the data or size is ee ff gg hhH.
aa + bb + cc + dd + ee + ff + gg + hh = sum
sum / 128 = quotient ... remainder
128 - remainder = checksum
(However, the checksum will be 0 if the remainder is 0.)
The SP-606 will process the data even if the received checksum is incorrect.

• While under most conditions, a computer similar to 
the above will permit normal operation of the P606, 
Roland cannot guarantee compatibility solely on 
these factors. This is due to numerous variables that 
may influence the processing environment, such as 
differences in motherboard design and the 
particular combination of other devices involved.

003
 
• Do not attempt to repair the unit, or replace 
parts within it (except when this manual 
provides specific instructions directing you 
to do so). Refer all servicing to your retailer, 
the nearest Roland Service Center, or an 
authorized Roland distributor, as listed on 
the “Information” page.
................................................................................................
 
004
 
• Never use or store the unit in places that are:
• Subject to temperature extremes (e.g.,

• Be sure to use only the AC adaptor supplied 
with the unit. Also, make sure the line 
voltage at the installation matches the input 
voltage specified on the AC adaptor’s body. 
Other AC adaptors may use a different 
polarity, or be designed for a different 
voltage, so their use could result in damage, 
malfunction, or electric shock.

fortable. If you experience any hearing loss or 
ringing in the ears, you should immediately 
stop using the unit, and consult an audiol-
ogist.
