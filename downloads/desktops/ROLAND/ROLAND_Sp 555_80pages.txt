USING THE UNIT SAFELY
 
• Before using this unit, make sure to read the instructions 
below, and the Owner’s Manual.
....................................................................................................
• Do not open (or modify in any way) the unit or its AC 
adaptor.
....................................................................................................
• Do not attempt to repair the unit, or replace parts within it 
(except when this manual provides specific instructions 
directing you to do so). Refer all servicing to your retailer, the 
nearest Roland Service Center, or an authorized Roland 
distributor, as listed on the “Information” page.
....................................................................................................
• Never use or store the unit in places that are:
• Subject to temperature extremes (e.g., direct sunlight in 
an enclosed vehicle, near a heating duct, on top of heat-
generating equipment); or are
• Damp (e.g., baths, washrooms, on wet floors); or are
• Humid; or are
• Exposed to rain; or are
• Dusty; or are
• Subject to high levels of vibration.
....................................................................................................
• This unit should be used only with a stand that is recom-
mended by Roland.
....................................................................................................
• When using the unit a stand recommended by Roland, the 
stand must be carefully placed so it is level and sure to 
remain stable. If not using a stand, you still need to make sure 
that any location you choose for placing the unit provides a 
level surface that will properly support the unit, and keep it 
from wobbling.
....................................................................................................
• Be sure to use only the AC adaptor supplied with the unit. 
Also, make sure the line voltage at the installation matches 
the input voltage specified on the AC adaptor’s body. Other 
AC adaptors may use a different polarity, or be designed for 
a different voltage, so their use could result in damage, 
malfunction, or electric shock.
....................................................................................................
• Use only the attached power-supply cord. Also, the supplied 
power cord must not be used with any other device.
....................................................................................................
• Do not excessively twist or bend the power cord, nor place 
heavy objects on it. Doing so can damage the cord, 
producing severed elements and short circuits. Damaged 
cords are fire and shock hazards!
....................................................................................................
• This unit, either alone or in combination with an amplifier and 
headphones or speakers, may be capable of producing 
sound levels that could cause permanent hearing loss. Do not 
operate for a long period of time at a high volume level, or at 
a level that is uncomfortable. If you experience any hearing 
loss or ringing in the ears, you should immediately stop using 
the unit, and consult an audiologist.
....................................................................................................

USING THE UNIT SAFELY
 
• Do not allow any objects (e.g., flammable material, coins, 
pins); or liquids of any kind (water, soft drinks, etc.) to 
penetrate the unit.
....................................................................................................
• In households with small children, an adult should provide 
supervision until the child is capable of following all the rules 
essential for the safe operation of the unit.
....................................................................................................
• Protect the unit from strong impact.
(Do not drop it!)
....................................................................................................
• Do not force the unit’s power-supply cord to share an outlet 
with an unreasonable number of other devices. Be especially 
careful when using extension cords—the total power used by 
all devices you have connected to the extension cord’s outlet 
must never exceed the power rating (watts/amperes) for the 
extension cord. Excessive loads can cause the insulation on 
the cord to heat up and eventually melt through.
....................................................................................................
• Before using the unit in a foreign country, consult with your 
retailer, the nearest Roland Service Center, or an authorized 
Roland distributor, as listed on the “Information” page.
....................................................................................................
• DO NOT play a CD-ROM disc on a conventional audio CD 
player. The resulting sound may be of a level that could cause 
permanent hearing loss. Damage to speakers or other system 
components may result.
• The unit and the AC adaptor should be located so their 
location or position does not interfere with their proper venti-
lation.
....................................................................................................
• This (SP-555) for use only with Roland stand PDS-10. Use 
with other stands is capable of resulting in instability causing 
possible injury.
....................................................................................................
• This stand for use only with specific Roland musical instru-
ments. See apparatus instructions. Use with other models is 
capable of resulting in instability causing possible injury.
....................................................................................................
• Always grasp only the plug on the AC adaptor cord when 
plugging into, or unplugging from, an outlet or this unit.
....................................................................................................
• At regular intervals, you should unplug the AC adaptor and 
clean it by using a dry cloth to wipe all dust and other 
accumulations away from its prongs. Also, disconnect the 
power plug from the power outlet whenever the unit is to 
remain unused for an extended period of time. Any accumu-
lation of dust between the power plug and the power outlet 
can result in poor insulation and lead to fire.
....................................................................................................
• Try to prevent cords and cables from becoming entangled. 
Also, all cords and cables should be placed so they are out 
of the reach of children.
....................................................................................................
• Never climb on top of, nor place heavy objects on the unit.
....................................................................................................
• Never handle the AC adaptor or its plugs with wet hands 
when plugging into, or unplugging from, an outlet or this unit.
....................................................................................................
• Before moving the unit, disconnect the AC adaptor and all 
cords coming from external devices.
....................................................................................................
• Before cleaning the unit, turn off the power and unplug the 
AC adaptor from the outlet (Quick Start Guide).
....................................................................................................
• Whenever you suspect the possibility of lightning in your 
area, disconnect the AC adaptor from the outlet.
....................................................................................................
• Should you remove screws for CARD LOCK, keep them in a 
safe place out of children’s reach, so there is no chance of 
them being swallowed accidentally.
....................................................................................................
• Always turn the phantom power off when connecting any 
device other than condenser microphones that require 
phantom power. You risk causing damage if you mistakenly 
supply phantom power to dynamic microphones, audio 
playback devices, or other devices that don’t require such 
power. Be sure to check the specifications of any microphone 
you intend to use by referring to the manual that came with it.
(This instrument’s phantom power: 48 V DC, 10 mA Max)

IMPORTANT NOTES
 
In addition to the items listed under “USING THE UNIT SAFELY” on p. 4, please read and observe the following:
 
Power Supply
 
• Do not connect this unit to same electrical outlet that is being used by 
an electrical appliance that is controlled by an inverter (such as a 
refrigerator, washing machine, microwave oven, or air conditioner), 
or that contains a motor. Depending on the way in which the 
electrical appliance is used, power supply noise may cause this unit to 
malfunction or may produce audible noise. If it is not practical to use 
a separate electrical outlet, connect a power supply noise filter 
between this unit and the electrical outlet.
• The AC adaptor will begin to generate heat after long hours of 
consecutive use. This is normal, and is not a cause for concern.
• Before connecting this unit to other devices, turn off the power to all 
units. This will help prevent malfunctions and/or damage to speakers 
or other devices.
 
Placement
 
• Using the unit near power amplifiers (or other equipment containing 
large power transformers) may induce hum. To alleviate the problem, 
change the orientation of this unit; or move it farther away from the 
source of interference.
• This device may interfere with radio and television reception. Do not 
use this device in the vicinity of such receivers.
• Noise may be produced if wireless communications devices, such as 
cell phones, are operated in the vicinity of this unit. Such noise could 
occur when receiving or initiating a call, or while conversing. Should 
you experience such problems, you should relocate such wireless 
devices so they are at a greater distance from this unit, or switch them 
off.
• Do not expose the unit to direct sunlight, place it near devices that 
radiate heat, leave it inside an enclosed vehicle, or otherwise subject 
it to temperature extremes. Excessive heat can deform or discolor the 
unit.
• When moved from one location to another where the temperature 
and/or humidity is very different, water droplets (condensation) may 
form inside the unit. Damage or malfunction may result if you attempt 
to use the unit in this condition. Therefore, before using the unit, you 
must allow it to stand for several hours, until the condensation has 
completely evaporated.
• Depending on the material and temperature of the surface on which 
you place the unit, its rubber feet may discolor or mar the surface.
You can place a piece of felt or cloth under the rubber feet to prevent 
this from happening. If you do so, please make sure that the unit will 
not slip or move accidentally.
 
Maintenance
 
• For everyday cleaning wipe the unit with a soft, dry cloth or one that 
has been slightly dampened with water. To remove stubborn dirt, use 
a cloth impregnated with a mild, non-abrasive detergent. Afterwards, 
be sure to wipe the unit thoroughly with a soft, dry cloth.
• Never use benzine, thinners, alcohol or solvents of any kind, to avoid 
the possibility of discoloration and/or deformation.
 
Repairs and Data
 
• Please be aware that all data contained in the unit’s memory may be 
lost when the unit is sent for repairs. Important data should always be 
backed up on a CompactFlash card, or written down on paper (when 
possible). During repairs, due care is taken to avoid the loss of data. 
However, in certain cases (such as when circuitry related to memory 
itself is out of order), we regret that it may not be possible to restore 
the data, and Roland assumes no liability concerning such loss of 
data.
 
Additional Precautions
 
• Please be aware that the contents of memory can be irretrievably lost 
as a result of a malfunction, or the improper operation of the unit. To 
protect yourself against the risk of loosing important data, we 
recommend that you periodically save a backup copy of important 
data you have stored in the unit’s memory on a CompactFlash card.
• Unfortunately, it may be impossible to restore the contents of data that 
was stored in the unit’s memory or CompactFlash card once it has 
been lost. Roland Corporation assumes no liability concerning such 
loss of data.
• Use a reasonable amount of care when using the unit’s buttons, 
sliders, or other controls; and when using its jacks and connectors. 
Rough handling can lead to malfunctions.
• When connecting / disconnecting all cables, grasp the connector 
itself—never pull on the cable. This way you will avoid causing shorts, 
or damage to the cable’s internal elements.
• To avoid disturbing your neighbors, try to keep the unit’s volume at 
reasonable levels. You may prefer to use headphones, so you do not 
need to be concerned about those around you (especially when it is 
late at night).
• When you need to transport the unit, package it in the box (including 
padding) that it came in, if possible. Otherwise, you will need to use 
equivalent packaging materials.
• Some connection cables contain resistors. Do not use cables that 
incorporate resistors for connecting to this unit. The use of such cables 
can cause the sound level to be extremely low, or impossible to hear. 
For information on cable specifications, contact the manufacturer of 
the cable.
• The sensitivity of the D Beam controller will change depending on the 
amount of light in the vicinity of the unit. If it does not function as you 
expect, adjust the sensitivity as appropriate for the brightness of your 
location.
• The explanations in this manual include illustrations that depict what 
should typically be shown by the display. Note, however, that your 
unit may incorporate a newer, enhanced version of the system (e.g., 
includes newer sounds), so what you actually see in the display may 
not always match what appears in the manual.

* Depending on the circumstances of a particular setup, you may 
experience a discomforting sensation, or perceive that the 
surface feels gritty to the touch when you touch this device, 
microphones connected to it, or the metal portions of other 
objects, such as guitars. This is due to an infinitesimal electrical 
charge, which is absolutely harmless. However, if you are 
concerned about this, connect the ground terminal (see figure) 
with an external ground. When the unit is grounded, a slight 
hum may occur, depending on the particulars of your 
installation. If you are unsure of the connection method, contact 
the nearest Roland Service Center, or an authorized Roland 
distributor, as listed on the “Information” page.

Playing samples
 
The SP-555 provides sixteen velocity-sensitive pads, which let you vary the volume according to the force with which you strike the 
pads. Striking a pad strongly will produce a louder sound, and striking it softly will produce a softer sound.
The SP-555 has ten sample banks: A–J.
Banks A and B use the SP-555’s internal memory. With the 
factory settings, bank A contains preloaded samples. If 
you’re using the SP-555’s internal memory, you can record 
a maximum of 32 samples with a total maximum of 
approximately five minutes.
Banks C–J are located on the memory card (CompactFlash). 
You can record up to 128 samples on a memory card.
The SP-555 can play up to twelve samples simultaneously. 
However, the polyphony is reduced as shown in the table 
below if you’re using stereo samples or if you’re resampling.
BANK A–BANK J
Banks A/B are in internal memory, and the remaining banks are on 
the CompactFlash card. Press a button to switch to the corresponding 
bank. Sixteen samples can be assigned to each bank. Select banks 
C--F by pressing a bank C--J button, causing it to light; select banks 
G--J by pressing a button twice so it's blinking.
GATE
If this is unlit, the sample will play to the end when you 
press a pad once. If you press this button so it's lit after 
pressing the desired pad, the sound will continue playing 
only while you continue pressing the pad.
LOOP
If this is unlit, the sample will play to the end and then 
stop. If you press this button so it's lit after pressing the 
desired pad, the sound will play repeatedly as a loop. 
REVERSE
If you press this button so it's lit after pressing the desired 
pad, the sample will play backward.
FIXED VELOCITY
If you press this button so it's lit, the sample will play at 
the same volume regardless of how strongly you strike 
the pad.
ROLL
If you hold down this button and press a pad, the sample 
will play as a "roll" as long as you continue holding 
down the pad. This produces a "drum roll" effect. By 
holding down this button and pressing HOLD, you can 
maintain the state of the pad being held down.
HOLD
If you press this button while holding down a pad, the 
playback will continue even if you release the pad. 
(This is valid only for pads for which GATE is turned on.) 
The sound will stop when you press the pad once again.
SUB PAD
When you press this pad, the sample assigned to the 
previously struck pad will be heard. You can use this to 
play repeated strikes using both hands.
CANCEL
By pressing this four times 
in rapid succession, you 
can stop playback of all 
samples.
PAD 1–PAD 16
Press a pad to play the sample assigned to that pad.
Lit red: A sample is assigned.
Unlit: No sample is assigned.

Pads for which GATE is turned on will start playing when you 
press the pad, and will stop playing when you release the 
pad (Gate playback).
In contrast, pads for which GATE is turned off will start 
playing when you press the pad, and will continue playing 
even when you release the pad (Trigger playback). Playback 
will stop when you reach the end (End Point) of the sample 
(only if Loop is turned off).
 
If you want a long phrase to continue playing, you should use 
Trigger playback + Loop playback. If you are playing drum-
type samples, you should use Trigger playback + One-shot 
playback. The sample will play to its end even if you press the 
pad for only an instant.
 
After sampling, the following settings are made automatically.
If the length resulting from automatic BPM calculation(p. 32) is 
less than one measure: Trigger Playback
If the length resulting from automatic BPM calculation (p. 32) is 
one measure or greater: Gate Playback
 
If you have specified Trigger playback + One-shot playback 
for a long sample, the sound may continue playing for longer 
than you would like. In this case, you can stop the playback by 
pressing [CANCEL] four times in rapid succession.
Gate on/off can be specified independently for each pad.

Using effects
 
The SP-555 contains 37 types of effects. However, you can 
use only one type of effect at a time. You can’t use a multiple 
number of effects at the same time.
By default, the effect will be applied only to the pad you 
pressed most recently (the “current pad”).
You can directly select the five effects 
 
SUPER FILTER
 
, 
 
VOICE TRANS
 
 (voice transformer), 
 
DELAY
 
, 
 
ISOLATOR
 
, 
and 
 
DJFX LOOPER
 
 by pressing a button. To choose one of 
the other effects, press the MFX button, then press a bank (A 
or B), and finally press a pad 1–16 to select the desired 
effect.
The SP-555 has an effect memory function, which lets you 
use [EFFECT MEMORY] to store and instantly switch among 
up to sixteen effect settings.
 
1.
 
Press the pads to find the sample to which you want to 
apply an effect. The effect will be applied to the pad 
you pressed last (the “current pad”).
 
2.
 
Press the appropriate button for the effect you want to 
apply.
 
To select SUPER FILTER, VOICE TRANS, DELAY, 
ISOLATOR, or DJFX LOOPER, simply press the 
corresponding button. For MFX, hold down [MFX] and 
turn the CTRL 3 knob to select an effect while viewing 
the display.
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 1–CTRL 3 knobs to adjust the effect.
 
The parameters that are controlled by the CTRL 1–CTRL 
3 knobs will depend on the effect type. Refer to 
 
“Effect 
list”
 
 (p. 54).
If you want to apply an effect to the mic/line input as well, 
hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] and press [MIC] or [LINE IN].
 
* The effect will be applied to both the line input and mic. You 
can’t apply the effect to just one or the other.
 
You can use [EFFECT MEMORY] to store and instantly call 
up EFFECT settings (effect type and CTRL 1/2/3 knob 
values).
 
1.
 
Make the necessary settings for the effect, so it’s in the 
state you want to store.
 
2.
 
Press [EFFECT MEMORY].
 
3.
 
Press [SAMPLING]. Pads 1–16 will blink.
 
4.
 
Press the pad to which you want to store the effect 
settings. The pad you pressed will light, and 
[SAMPLING] will blink.
 
5.
 
Press [SAMPLING] to store the current effect settings.
 
1.
 
Press [EFFECT MEMORY] so the button is lit.
 
2.
 
Press a pad 1–16 to call up the stored settings.
 
The effect type and the values for the CTRL 1/2/3 knobs 
will be called up. 
 
Since the values for the CTRL 1/2/3 knobs that existed at the 
time you stored the effect are given priority, the current 
physical position of the CTRL 1/2/3 knobs will not match the 
effect that is applied.
 
1.
 
Press [EFFECT MEMORY] so the button is lit.
 
2.
 
Hold down [REMAIN], and press the pad that you want 
to check.
 
While you hold down [REMAIN], the LED for the effect 
type stored at that pad will blink (if the effect is one of 
the five types that can be selected directly by a button), 
or the 7-segment LED will indicate the bank and number 
(A.1–B.16).

Using effects
 
The SP-555 lets you choose either of the following two 
methods of operation to specify what will happen to the knob 
settings when you switch from one type of effect to another.
 
1.
 
While holding down [CANCEL], press [SUPER FILTER]. 
Each time you press [SUPER FILTER], the display’s 
indication will alternate between “C.nL” and “C.JP.”
 
“C.JP” (Jump):
The setting of the parameter will match the knob 
position the instant you turn the knob.
“C.nL” (Null):
When you start turning the knob, the setting will not 
actually change until the knob position passes 
through the current value of the setting.
When you turn on the power, this is always set to 
“C.JP” (Jump).
 
Applying the same effect to more than 
one pad (EFFECT ASSIGN)
 
To apply the same effect to one or more pads in addition to 
the current pad, hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] and press the 
desired pad.
The same effect is applied to each pad that lights when you 
press [EFFECT ASSIGN].
 
If you hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] while together pressing 
both [PAD 1] and [PAD 16], you can simultaneously turn the 
effect on/off for all pads in that bank.
 
By default, if you select as the current pad a pad to which 
the effect is not applied, and then turn the effect on/off or 
change the effect settings, the effect assign settings will be 
cancelled, so that the effect is applied only to the current 
pad.
 
Effect assign mode
 
If you hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] and press [REMAIN], 
the [EFFECT ASSIGN] button will light. In this state, the 
EFFECT ASSIGN setting for each pad will not be cancelled 
even if you change the current pad.
If you once again hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] and press 
[REMAIN], the [EFFECT ASSIGN] button will go out, and the 
EFFECT ASSIGN setting will change when you change the 
current pad.
 
You can also change the power-on default state. (

Using effects
 
Applying an effect to all pads
 
Here’s how to apply the effect to all pads of banks A–J.
 
1.
 
Make sure that [PATTERN SELECT] is extinguished. If it 
is lit, press [PATTERN SELECT] to turn it off.
 
2.
 
While holding down [EFFECT ASSIGN], press [SUB 
PAD]. All bank buttons and all pads will light (the 
current pad will blink).
 
If you want to return to the state in which the effect is 
applied only to the current pad, once again hold down 
[EFFECT ASSIGN] and press [SUB PAD] so that only the 
current pad blinks.
 
Turning on the effect only while you 
hold down the button (EFFECT GRAB)
 
Normally, the effect will turn on when you press the button, 
and turn off when you press the button again.
If you hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] and press an effect 
button (or [MFX]), the effect will be on only while you 
continue pressing it, and turn off when you release it. This is 
convenient when you want to rapidly turn an effect on and 
off.
 
About the effect tempo
 
Effect tempo mode
 
The parameters of some effects, such as the delay time of a 
delay-type effect or BPM LOOPER, will synchronize to the 
BPM of the sample.
By default, these are set to synchronize with the BPM of the 
current pad. However, if you hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] 
and press [PATTERN SELECT], the effect will synchronize to 
the tempo of the pattern sequencer, regardless of the BPM of 
the current pad.
 
You can also change the power-on default state. (
 
➜
 
 
 
“Effect 
Tempo Mode”
 
 (p. 63) in 
 
“Parameters whose power-on 
default setting can be changed.”
 
)
If you hold down [EFFECT ASSIGN] and press [TAP TEMPO], 
the effect will temporarily synchronize to the tempo of the 
pattern sequencer, and the pattern of effects that have a 
pattern (*1) will be reset.
*1 SLICER+FLG (A-13), STEP FILTER (B-13), STEP RING MOD 
(B-14), BPM LOOPER (B-15)
 
About the lit, extinguished, and 
blinking effect buttons
 
• When the effect of the current pad is on, the button of 
the effect being used will light. (In the case of MFX, the 
[MFX] button will light.)
• If the current pad’s effect is off, and the effect is turned 
on for a source other than the current pad (i.e., for 
another pad, EXT SOURCE, USB AUDIO, D BEAM), 
the effect button will blink.
• If the effect is turned on for all sources, the effect 
buttons will be extinguished.
 
Checking the previously used effect
 
If you press [EFFECT ASSIGN], the button of the previously 
used effect will blink.
 
Presetting the parameters of the effect 
you’ll be using next
 
While holding down [REMAIN], turn the CTRL 1–CTRL 3 
knobs to adjust the parameters. Next, press an effect button, 
and the effect will be applied with the parameter values you 
set in advance.
 
Effect Limit mode
 
By using Effect Limit mode, you can prevent unintentionally 
loud sounds from being produced by an effect that uses 
feedback or resonance. Hold down [CANCEL] and press 
[MFX]. Limit mode is on if the display indicates “L.on,” and 
off if the Display indicates “L.oF.”
Some effects do not have a limit mode.
This will be off when you turn on the power.

Sampling (recording)
 
When using internal memory
 
If you sample to bank A or B, the sample is stored in internal 
memory. Internal memory can hold up to 32 samples. If you 
reach 32 samples, you won’t be able to record further 
samples.
 
* This includes the 
 
PRELOADED
 
 
 
SAMPLES
 
 
 
THAT
 
 
 
ARE
 
 
 
ASSIGNED
 
 to bank 
A when the SP-555 is shipped from the factory.
* LO-FI: This mode provides the distinctive low-fidelity sound that 
is typical of early digital devices. It allows longer sampling 
times, but the sound quality is not as good as STANDARD. 
Once you record a sample using LO-FI, you can’t regain the 
original sound quality, even if you resample it using 
STANDARD.
 
When using CompactFlash
 
If you sample to banks C–J, the sample is stored on 
CompactFlash. A CompactFlash card can hold up to 128 
samples, regardless of the capacity of the card. If you reach 
128 samples, you won’t be able to record further samples.
 
Remaining sampling time
 
When you press [REMAIN], the display will indicate the 
remaining time.
The remaining time in internal memory is shown if an internal 
memory bank is selected, and the remaining time on the 
CompactFlash is shown if a CompactFlash bank is selected.
 
The indication shows the time available for sampling in 
monaural/standard mode.
 
The remaining time indication is an estimate.

Sampling (recording)
 
* During this procedure, you can cancel the preceding steps by 
pressing [CANCEL].
 
1.
 
Make sure that [PATTERN SELECT] is off (extinguished).
 
2.
 
Press [SAMPLING].
 
3.
 
Press a bank button to specify the bank into which you 
want to sample. When you press a bank button, the 
pads within that bank to which you can sample (i.e., 
pads that do not contain a sample) will blink.
 
4.
 
Press one of the blinking pads to specify the sampling-
destination pad.
 
5.
 
Only the specified pad will be lit, and [SAMPLING] will 
blink.
 
6.
 
Press [LO-FI] to select the sampling 
 
[LO-FI] unlit: STANDARD (high quality)
[LO-FI] lit: LO-FI (low fidelity)
 
LO-FI provides the distinctive low-fidelity sound that is typical of 
early digital devices. If you select LO-FI, you won’t be able to 
monitor the sampled result during sampling. When sampling is 
finished, you can press the pad to play back the sample for 
auditioning. Once you record a sample using LO-FI, you can’t 
regain the original sound quality, even if you resample it using 
STANDARD.
 
7.
 
Press [STEREO] to select either stereo or monaural 
sampling.
 
[STEREO] lit: Stereo sampling
[STEREO] unlit:  Monaural sampling
Now you’re ready to sample.
 
1.
 
From standby mode, press [SAMPLING] to begin 
sampling.
 
If you’re sampling from a CD or MP3 player, put your 
CD or MP3 player in playback mode, and press 
[SAMPLING] at the appropriate moment. During 
sampling, the display will indicate 
 
“rEC.”
 
2.
 
Press [SAMPLING] once again to stop sampling.
 
To hear the result, press the pad to which you sampled. 
Even if there is unwanted sound or silence at the 
beginning or end of the sample, you can adjust the start 
or end point so that these unwanted portions are not 
heard.
 
Since the BPM value that is displayed after sampling is an 
estimated value that is calculated from the sampled time, it 
may not be accurate. This means that even if two samples 
have the same BPM value, they may drift apart in timing if they 
are played as continuous loops for an extended time.
 
The Auto Sampling function will cause sampling to begin 
automatically when the input signal (sound) exceeds a 
specified level. This is convenient when you want to begin 
sampling from the introduction of a song. Before you enter 
sampling standby mode, adjust the sampling trigger level as 
described below.
 
1.
 
Hold down [CANCEL] and press [SAMPLING]. 
[SAMPLING] will blink, and the display will indicate 
“-0-.”
 
2.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 (LEVEL) knob to set the level.
 
The sampling trigger level will be the level at which the 
PEAK indicator lights. Turning the knob toward the right 
will raise the level. The display will indicate the level 
you specified (ten stages, 0–9).
 
When “-0-” is indicated, conventional sampling will occur 
(i.e., auto sampling will not be used). Choose the “-0-” setting 
if you don’t want to use auto sampling.
 
3.
 
To check the sampling trigger level, press [SAMPLING] 
once again.
 
When you start sampling with auto sampling specified, 
the display will indicate “rdY” until a signal exceeding 
the sampling trigger level is received.

Sampling (recording)
 
If you specify the BPM (tempo) while you’re still in sampling 
standby mode, the end point (the timing at which the sound 
stops playing) will be automatically set after sampling to a 
beat of the BPM value you specified.
 
1.
 
Enter sampling standby mode.
 
2.
 
Press [TIME/BPM] so the button is lit.
 
3.
 
Set the BPM, either by pressing [TAP TEMPO] in time 
with the beat, or by holding down [TAP TEMPO] and 
turning the CTRL 2 knob.
 
Permissible values for the BPM range from 40 up to 200. 
However, if the BPM is within the 40–60 or 160–180 ranges, 
it can be set only in even-numbered values. If the BPM is 
above 180, you can set it to either 180, 183, 186, 190, 
193, 196, or 200.
 
4.
 
Press [TIME/BPM] to turn off the button’s light.
 
5.
 
Press [SAMPLING] to start sampling.
 
6.
 
Press [SAMPLING] once again to stop sampling.
 
To hear the result, press the pad to which you sampled.
 
If you specify the BPM (tempo) while in sampling standby 
mode, the timing at which the sound stops playing (the end 
point) will automatically be set to a beat of the BPM value you 
assigned before pressing the button. This means that [MARK] 
will light automatically to indicate that the end point has been 
set. For more about the end point, refer to 
 
“Adjusting the 
playback region of a sample”
 
 (p. 28).
 
If the sampled time is multiple measures or less than one 
measure, the BPM indication may be double or half. In this 
case, press [TIME/BPM] so the button is lit, then turn the CTRL 
2 (BPM) knob to set the desired value. Refer to 
 
“Changing a 
sample’s BPM”
 
 (p. 32).
 
The displayed BPM value is an approximation derived from 
the sampled time, and may not be accurate.
 
Depending on the BPM value, the time corresponding to the 
BPM may not precisely match the time from the start point to 
the end point. For this reason if you use 
 
“Loop playback”
 
 (p. 
17) to continuously play a sample for an extended time, the 
timing will gradually drift.
 
You can add a count-in (1, 2, 3, 4) when you start sampling. 
This is convenient when you are sampling with a specific 
tempo or time signature in mind.
 
1.
 
Specify the tempo as described in steps 1–4 of 
 
“Sampling with a specified tempo”
 
 (p. 23)
 
2.
 
Press [START/END/LEVEL] so the button is lit.
 
3.
 
When you press [SAMPLING], the metronome will 
sound, and the display will successively indicate 
“-1-” 
 
➜
 
 “-2-” 
 
➜
 
 “-3-” 
 
➜
 
 “-4-” 
 
➜
 
 “rEC.”
 
Sampling will begin when the “rEC” indication 
appears.
 
1.
 
Before you continue, make sure of the sample you 
want to delete.
 
2.
 
Press [DEL].
 
3.
 
The display will indicate “dEL,” and pads to which 
samples are assigned will blink.
 
4.
 
Press the pad of the sample that you want to delete. 
When you press a pad, the pad will change from 
blinking to lit.
 
5.
 
If you want to delete the samples from several pads, 
press the appropriate pads at this point. You can select 
multiple pads simultaneously if they are in the same 
bank.
 
* If you decide to cancel the operations you’ve performed up to 
this point, press [CANCEL].
 
6.
 
When you press [DEL], the samples will start being 
deleted. When the deletion is complete, the “dEL” 
indication in the display will disappear.
 
* Never turn off the power before the deletion is complete. Doing 
so may destroy not only the samples being deleted, but also 
other samples, or damage the CompactFlash card itself.
* Once you press [DEL] to begin deleting the samples, you won’t 
be able to cancel the operation by pressing [CANCEL].
* If you specify a bank that is protected (p. 51), the display will 
indicate “Prt” (Protected), and you won’t be able to delete 
anything.

The indication in the display will change from “rdY” to 
“rEC.” When “rEC” disappears, saving is complete.
 
Never turn off the power while saving is in progress. Turning 
off the power may destroy not only the sample that’s being 
saved, but also other samples as well.
 
Since Loop Capture and Sampling use different internal 
processing, the length of a phrase recorded by Loop Capture 
will not precisely match the length of the sample saved in the 
pad. For this reason, the sample’s BPM may be slightly 
different, or even if the BPM values are the same, timing drift 
may occur if you loop the sound for an extended time.
 
The sample will be saved in the pad with the GATE setting 
turned on. Its end point (p. 28) will be set at an appropriate 
location according to the BPM. If necessary, you can execute 
Truncate (p. 31) to delete any unwanted portion of the sample.
 
Saving a recorded phrase to a pad
Tips for using Loop Capture
Selecting the source for Loop Capture
If [SOURCE SELECT] is set to EXT ONLY, you’ll be 
recording only the sound from the external input (MIC/
LINE IN) and the sound from the monophonic 
synthesizer controlled by the D Beam controller. This is 
useful when you want to play an instrument along with 
the pad performance or pattern sequencer.
* If you use this setting, the effect will not be applied to the 
pad performance during recording.
Effects for Loop Capture
You can’t apply an effect to the phrase recorded by 
Loop Capture. If you want to apply an effect to the Loop 
Capture sound, use [SAVE TO PAD] to save the phrase 
to a pad.
Loop Capture will record the sound processed by all 
effects.
Automatically starting sampling (Auto Start)
The Auto Start function lets you automatically start 
recording when a signal (sound) greater than a 
specified level is received.
If you’ve pressed [AUTO START], pressing [REC] will 
put the SP-555 in standby mode, and recording will 
begin when a signal is input.
This function is independent of the sampling function 
Auto Sampling.

Editing a sample
 
Here’s how to adjust the volume of each pad.
 
1.
 
Make sure that [PATTERN SELECT] is extinguished. If it 
is lit, press [PATTERN SELECT] to turn it off.
 
2.
 
Press the pad to which the sample whose volume you 
want to adjust is assigned. The pad will light, and that 
sample will play.
 
3.
 
Press [START/END/LEVEL] so the button is lit.
 
4.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 (LEVEL) knob to adjust the sample’s 
volume.
 
5.
 
When you’ve finished making adjustments, press 
[START/END/LEVEL] to turn off its light.
 
Turning the CTRL 3 (LEVEL) knob toward the left will 
reduce the volume, and turning it toward the right will 
increase the volume. A setting of 127 is the maximum 
volume. The default value immediately after sampling is 
127.
 
While [START/END/LEVEL] is lit, you can adjust not only the 
volume but also the start point and end point (p. 29) by using 
the CTRL 1 and 2 knobs. If you’ve moved the CTRL 1 or 2 
knobs by accident, set them back to the center position. The 
settings will return to their previous values. If you press 
[START/END/LEVEL] to turn off the button’s light without 
returning the knobs to the center, the modified start point and 
end point settings will be set.
 
For each sample, the SP-555 lets you specify the region 
within the sample’s waveform data that will actually play.
The point within the waveform data at which playback will 
begin is called the Start Point, and the point at which 
playback will end is the End Point.
If there is unwanted sound or silence at the beginning of a 
sampled sound, you can omit this by adjusting the Start 
Point. If the unwanted material is at the end, you can adjust 
the End Point.
 
When you specify the start point or end point, the BPM 
(tempo) will be automatically calculated according to the 
newly specified duration, and displayed. If the duration is 
multiple measures or less than one measure, the displayed 
BPM value may be half or double the actual value. To set the 
BPM to the desired value, refer to 
 
“Changing a sample’s 
BPM”
 
 (p. 32).
 
In some cases, such as if the length of the region is three 
beats, it may not be possible to calculate or adjust the BPM 
value correctly.
 
[MARK] will light if you’ve specified either the start point or 
end point. If you want to cancel these settings, press the lit 
[MARK] button during playback to turn off the button’s light.
 
By carrying out the procedure explained in 
 
“Converting to a 
sample that has a modified playback region”
 
 (p. 31), you 
can delete the portions other than the specified playback 
region, so that the start point and end point are the beginning 
and end of the sample.

• You can’t adjust the playback region beyond the 
beginning or end of the sample.
• If you decide to cancel the adjustment, return the CTRL 1 
and 2 knobs to the center position so that the indication is 
“0.”
• The range of movement for a single operation is 
approximately 130 milliseconds before or after the current 
start point or end point. If you want to adjust the point by a 
greater amount, repeat the same procedure.
• You can’t set the start point and end point closer than 
approximately 100 milliseconds.
• If your adjustment results in the start point and end point 
being respectively at the beginning and end of the sample, 
[MARK] will go out.
• If [MARK] is extinguished (i.e., if the playback region has 
not been adjusted), adjusting the sample’s start point or 
end point will cause [MARK] to light.
• When you move the start point or end point, the sample’s 
BPM (tempo) will automatically change accordingly. 
However, there will be a small discrepancy in the BPM.
 
You can exchange samples between two pads. This lets you

Editing a sample
 
A sample’s BPM (tempo) is automatically determined by the 
length between the sample’s start point and end point. 
However, depending on this length, the calculated BPM 
value may be half or double the actual BPM. In this case, you 
can correct the BPM as follows.
 
1.
 
Play the pad that you want to change, making it the 
current pad.
 
2.
 
Press [TIME/BPM] so the button is lit.
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 2 (BPM) knob to change the BPM value. 
Turn the knob toward the left if you want to halve the 
displayed value, or toward the right if you want to 
double it.
 
4.
 
When you’ve made the change, press [TIME/BPM] 
once again to turn off the button’s light.
 
While you’re performing this operation, the CTRL 1 knob will 
perform the Time Modify function. Be careful not to change it 
inadvertently.
 
If you want to consecutively play samples of differing tempo, 
you can use the Time Modify function to create natural-
sounding transitions so that the tempo is not interrupted.
If you’ve specified Reverse Playback(p. 15), the Time Modify 
setting is disabled, and the effect won’t be obtained. If you 
want to use Time Modify, you must turn off Reverse Playback.
 
1.
 
Play the pad that you want to change, making it the 
current pad.
 
2.
 
Press [TIME/MODIFY] so the button is lit.
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 1 (TIME) knob to change the length. The 
display will indicate the sample length in terms of the 
BPM.
 
4.
 
When you’ve finished making the change, press [TIME/
BPM] once again to turn off the button’s light.
 
Turning the CTRL 1 (TIME) knob all the way to the left will turn 
Time Modify off, so that the sample will play at its original 
length. (The display will indicate “oFF.”)
 
Turning the CTRL 1 (TIME) knob all the way to the right will 
cause the sample to play at the tempo of the pattern. (The 
display will indicate “Ptn.”)
 
The BPM can be adjusted to any value from half to 
approximately 1.3 times the original BPM. However, the BPM 
must fall within the 40–200 range. 
 
If Time Modify is set to “Ptn,” the tempo of the sample will 
change according to the pattern’s tempo within a range of 
between half and approximately 1.3 times the sample’s 
original BPM. If the pattern’s tempo is set outside this range, 
the sample’s tempo is limited to the maximum value (200) or 
minimum value (40).
 
Please be aware that a sample for which you’ve specified 
Time Modify may sound quavery or noisy.

Playing samples and recording your 
performance (Pattern Sequencer)
 
The SP-555 provides a Pattern Sequencer, which lets you 
play samples and record your performance. You can play 
samples, record your performance as a “pattern,” and then 
play back the recorded pattern. You can create a song by 
putting together various phrase samples, or create a rhythm 
pattern by putting together rhythm samples.
When [PATTERN SELECT] is lit, one pattern each can be 
assigned to the sixteen pads (1–16) of the panel. After a 
pattern has been assigned to each pad, such a collection of 
sixteen patterns is called a “pattern bank.” The SP-555 lets 
you use ten pattern banks, A–J. Pattern banks A and B are 
located in the SP-555’s internal memory, and pattern banks 
C–J are on the CompactFlash card.
 
When the power is turned on, pattern bank A is selected.
 
When [PATTERN SELECT] is lit, you can use BANK [A]–[F/J] 
to specify the pattern bank, and pads 1–16 to specify the 
pattern.
The pattern tempo setting is shared by all patterns. You can’t 
specify a different tempo for each pattern.
 
1.
 
Set the BPM either by pressing [TAP TEMPO] at the 
desired tempo or by holding down [TAP TEMPO] and 
turning the CTRL 2 knob.
 
[TAP TEMPO] will light when the display shows the pattern 
tempo.
 
If the pattern tempo is synchronized to the tempo of your MIDI 
sequencer (p. 69), the display will indicate “Mid” and you 
won’t be able to perform the operations described below.
 
The BPM can be set to any value from 40 to 200. However, if 
the BPM is a value within the 40–60 or 160–180 ranges, it 
can be set only in even-numbered values. If the BPM is above 
180, you can set it to either 180, 183, 186, 190, 193, 196, 
or 200.
 
When [PATTERN SELECT] is lit, playback will start when you 
press a pad to which a pattern is assigned. Once playback 
starts, the pattern will continue playing even after you take 
your finger off the pad.
To stop the currently playing pattern, press [CANCEL] 
(PATTERN STOP).
You can also stop pattern playback by pressing the pad of 
the currently playing pattern (i.e., the pad that is lit).
 
1.
 
Press [PATTERN SELECT] so the button is lit.
 
The display will indicate the currently playing measure 
and beat, and pads to which patterns are assigned will 
light.
 
2.
 
Press one of the BANK [A]–[F/J] buttons to select the 
bank containing the pattern you want to play next.
 
To select a bank G–J, press BANK [C/G]–[F/J] once 
again so the button is blinking. If no CompactFlash card 
is inserted, you won’t be able to select pattern banks C–
J.
 
3.
 
Press the pad for the pattern that you want to play 
next.
 
If you press another pad while a pattern is playing, it 
will be reserved as the pattern to be played next. When 
the currently playing pattern has played to the end, the 
reserved pattern will automatically begin playing.
 
If you hold down [SUB PAD] while you press a pad, playback 
will switch immediately to the pattern of that pad.
 
If you press a pad to which no pattern is assigned (i.e., a pad 
that is not lit), nothing will happen.

Playing samples and recording your performance (Pattern Sequencer)
 
When you play samples and record your performance as a 
pattern, recording will occur repeatedly for the number of 
measures you specify (i.e., “loop recording”), allowing you 
to continue layering (overdubbing) additional samples onto 
the pattern.
 
1.
 
Press [PATTERN SELECT] so the button is lit.
 
The display will indicate “Ptn” and the pads to which a 
pattern is assigned will blink.
 
2.
 
Press [SAMPLING] so the button is lit.
 
All pads to which no pattern is assigned will blink.
 
3.
 
Press one of the BANK [A]–[F/J] buttons to select the 
pattern bank into which you want to record.
 
If no CompactFlash card is installed, you won’t be able to 
select pattern banks C–J.
 
4.
 
Press the pad to which you want to assign the pattern 
you’re going to record.
 
The pad you pressed will light, and the remaining pads 
will go out. [SAMPLING] will blink, and the metronome 
will begin sounding.
 
5.
 
Press [START/END/LEVEL] so the button is lit.
 
6.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 (LEVEL) knob to adjust the metronome 
volume.
 
7.
 
Press [TIME/BPM] so the button is lit.
 
The display will indicate the pattern tempo (BPM).
 
8.
 
Specify the pattern tempo, either by holding down [TAP 
TEMPO] and turning the CTRL 2 (BPM) knob, or by 
pressing [TAP TEMPO] several times at the desired 
tempo.
 
BPM range: 40–200. If the BPM is in the 40–60 or 160–180 
ranges, it can be set only in even-numbered values. If the BPM 
is above 180, you can set it to either 180, 183, 186, 190, 
193, 196, or 200.
 
9.
 
Press [LENGTH] so the button is lit.
 
The display will indicate the length (number of 
measures) of the pattern that will be recorded.
 
10.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 knob to specify the length of the 
pattern.
 
The display will indicate the pattern length you specify.
Range: 1–99
If the pattern already contains data, you can’t make it 
shorter than its current length.
You can specify the pattern length in one-measure units 
for the range of 1–20 measures, and in four-measure 
units for longer patterns.
 
11.
 
Press [QUANTIZE] so the button is lit.
 
[LENGTH] will go out, and the display will indicate the 
quantize setting.
 
What is quantization?
 
Quantization is a function that automatically corrects the slight 
inaccuracies in timing that can sometimes occur when you are 
pressing pads and playing samples to produce a recording. 
Once you’ve specified a quantize setting, your performance 
will be recorded at accurate intervals of quarter notes, eighth 
notes, or sixteenth notes. This function is particularly useful 
when you’re creating groove-based music and need the timing 
to be tight. This is also useful when you’re creating rhythm 
patterns.
 
12.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 knob to specify the desired quantize 
setting.
 
The display will indicate the quantize setting you 
specify.
The indication has the following significance.
S.8: Quantize to 8th notes using shuffle quantize.
S.16: Quantize to 16th notes using shuffle quantize.
4: Quantize to quarter notes.
4.3: Quantize to quarter-note triplets.
8: Quantize to eighth notes.
8.3: Quantize to eighth-note triplets.
16: Quantize to sixteenth notes.
16.3: Quantize to sixteenth-note triplets.
32: Quantize to thirty-second notes.
oFF: Quantize will not be used. The actual timing at 
which you pressed the pad will be recorded.
 
If you use shuffle quantize, use the CTRL 2 knob to specify the 
rate. The rate specifies the proportion by which the backbeats 
will be separated from the downbeats of the quantization 
you’ve specified. If this is set to “50,” each backbeat will be 
exactly between two adjacent downbeats. If this is set to “0,” 
each backbeat will be at the same timing as the preceding 
downbeat. If this is “100,” each backbeat will be at the same 
timing as the following downbeat.
 
13.
 
Press [QUANTIZE] to extinguish the button.
 
14.
 
Press [SAMPLING].
 
[SAMPLING] will change from blinking to lit, and 
recording will begin.
There will be a one-measure count before recording 
actually begins, so wait for one measure while listening 
to the metronome. During this time, the display will 
indicate a count of -4, -3, -2, -1.
When the count ends, recording will begin, and the 
display will indicate the measure and beat.
 
Pads you play during the count will not be recorded.

Playing samples and recording your performance (Pattern Sequencer)
 
15.
 
Press the pads at the desired timing.
 
During recording, you can use the pads to play 
samples. You can also press a bank button to switch 
sample banks.
The samples of the pads you pressed will play, and will 
be recorded at the timing specified by the selected 
quantize setting.
When the measure number shown in the display 
reaches the pattern length you specified, you will 
automatically return to measure one, and recording will 
continue (“loop recording”). The previously recorded 
performance will play back during this time.
If you press [SAMPLING] once again so the button is 
blinking, the display will indicate “rEH” and you’ll be in 
Rehearsal mode. In this state, pressing the pads will 
play the corresponding samples, but they won’t be 
recorded. When you press [SAMPLING] once again so 
the button is lit, you’ll exit Rehearsal mode and return to 
the conventional recording mode. This gives you a 
convenient way to find the next sample that you want to 
play.
 
16.
 
Press the pads of samples that you want to overdub.
 
The pad performance that you recorded on the previous 
pass will be recorded along with your newly added 
pad performance (overdubbed). You can use this 
method to gradually build up complex rhythms that 
would be impossible to play all at once.
During this recording process, you can change the 
quantization as follows.
 
1.
 
 Press [QUANTIZE] so the button is lit.
 
2.
 
 Turn the CTRL 3 knob to change the quantize setting.
 
3.
 
 When you’ve made the desired setting, press 
[QUANTIZE] to extinguish the button.
The new quantize setting will be applied 
immediately.
 
17.
 
When you want to stop recording, press [CANCEL].
 
The dot in the display will blink. When the blinking 
stops, recording is complete.
 
Never turn off the power while the dot is blinking. Doing so 
may destroy not only the pattern you recorded, but also other 
patterns or the CompactFlash card.
 
If you’ve played a sample by mistake while recording, you 
can use the corresponding pad to erase it from the recorded 
pattern.
 
1.
 
Press [PATTERN SELECT] so the button is lit.
 
The display will indicate “Ptn” and pads to which a 
pattern is assigned will blink.
 
2.
 
Press [SAMPLING] so the button is lit.
 
3.
 
Press the pad for the pattern containing the 
performance from which you want to delete the 
mistake.
 
The pad you pressed will light, and the other pads will 
go out. [SAMPLING] will blink, and the metronome will 
begin sounding.
 
4.
 
Press [SAMPLING].
 
[SAMPLING] will change from blinking to lit, and 
recording will begin.
The recorded performance will play back. If you press 
the pad of a sample at this time, it will be recorded.
 
5.
 
Press [DEL] so the button is lit.
 
The display will indicate “ErS.”

D Beam controller
 
The SP-555 provides a D Beam controller, which lets you 
modify the sound in various ways by moving your hand 
above it. You can choose one of three modes: [SYNTH] 
(monophonic synthesizer), which lets you control the pitch by 
your hand position; [FILTER], which lets you control the cutoff 
frequency; and [TRIGGER], which lets you trigger the desired 
pad.
 
The sensitivity of the D Beam controller will change depending 
on the brightness of the environment. If it does not operate as 
you expect, please readjust the sensitivity (D Beam Sens) as 
follows.
While holding down [CANCEL], press either [SYNTH], 
[FILTER], or [TRIGGER], and then use the CTRL 3 knob to adjust 
the sensitivity. Turning the knob toward the right will increase 
the sensitivity. When you’ve finished adjusting the sensitivity, 
you can press [SAMPLING] to save the setting.
 
If you press [SYNTH] so the button is lit, you’ll be able to use 
the SP-555 as a monophonic synthesizer whose pitch is 
controlled by the position of your hand above the D Beam 
controller. Moving your hand closer to the controller will 
raise the pitch in steps of the scale you select. Use [SYNTH] 
+ CTRL 2 to change the scale.
There’s also a built-in delay that can be used to produce a 
variety of effects.
[SYNTH] will blink when you’re within the effective range of 
the D Beam controller.
 
*1: Select one of the following effects
CHr: Chromatic Scale
tCH: Tcherepnin’s Scale
SPn: Spanish Scale
bLS: Blues Mixolydian Scale
Cd: Combination of Diminished Scale
MAJ: Diatonic Major Scale
Min: Natural Minor Scale
HMJ: Harmonic Major Scale
HMi: Harmonic minor Scale
dH: Double Harmonic Scale
MMi: Melodic Minor Scale
GPS: Gypsy Scale
doM: Dominant Scale
Wt: Whole Tone Scale
HbL: Hexatonic Blue Scale
AUG: Augmented Scale
rkY: Ryukyu Scale
iSd: In Sen Scale, Decending
iSA: In Sen Scale, Ascending
PMJ: Major Pentatonic Scale
PMi: Minor Pentatonic Scale
The effective range of the D Beam controller
The illustration below shows the effective range of the D 
Beam controller. Moving your hand beyond this range 
will not produce any effect.
The effective range of the D Beam controller will be 
greatly reduced under strong, direct sunlight. Please be 
aware of this when using the D Beam controller 
outdoors.

D Beam controller
 
If you press [FILTER] so the button is lit, you’ll be able to 
control the cutoff frequency of a filter by moving your hand 
above the controller.
[FILTER] will blink when you’re within the effective range of 
the D Beam controller.
Press [FILTER] + a pad to select the desired combination of 
filter type and resonance.
• Pad 1: Low-pass filter
• Pad 2: High-pass filter
• Pad 3: Band-pass filter
• Pad 4: Notch filter
Higher pads select a filter with stronger resonance.
If you press [TRIGGER] so the button is lit, you’ll be able to 
play the desired pad by moving your hand above the 
controller.
To specify the pad, hold down [TRIGGER] and press the 
desired pad 1–16.
 
Be aware that if you select Trigger and then switch the pad 
bank, the pad that will be triggered will not change, but the 
sample that will be played will be different.
 
You can use [TRIGGER] + CTRL 3 knob to specify the velocity 
at which the pad will play.
 
If you’re using Roll to play the pad, and you turn the D Beam 
controller [TRIGGER] on, you’ll be able to use the D Beam 
controller to control the volume of the roll.
 
If the SP-555 is in a state in which pressing a pad does not 
play a sample (e.g., if [PATTERN SELECT] is lit or if [EFFECT 
ASSIGN] is lit), you won’t be able to use the D Beam controller 
to trigger pads.

About CompactFlash
 
The SP-555 supports CompactFlash cards (type I) having a 
capacity of from 32 MB up to 2 GB.
 
* You can’t use Type II cards such as Microdrives.
 
As of this date, Roland has verified that the SP-555 will work 
correctly with the following memory cards.
 
* Even cards of the identical model may be unusable due to 
differences in the specific design of the card or differences in 
the conditions of use. We cannot completely guarantee all 
operation with the above models.
 
When the SP-555 is shipped from the factory, special screws 
are attached to the bottom panel at the locations marked by 
 
★
 
. With the memory card cover attached, you can use a 
Phillips screwdriver to remove these screws and reinstall 
them in the CARD LOCK screw holes, making it impossible 
to remove the memory card cover, and helping to prevent 
theft of the CompactFlash card.
 
When turning the unit upside-down, get a bunch of 
newspapers or magazines, and place them under the four 
corners or at both ends to prevent damage to the buttons and 
controls. Also, you should try to orient the unit so no buttons or 
controls get damaged.
 
When turning the unit upside-down, handle with care to avoid 
dropping it, or allowing it to fall or tip over.
* You must use only these screws. Using any other screws will 
cause malfunctions.

Importing audio files
Caution when importing audio files 
(WAV/AIFF)
• Use a CompactFlash card that was formatted by 
the SP-555.
• When you use your computer or other device to 
copy or save audio files (WAV/AIFF) on a 
CompactFlash card, place the files in the root 
directory (top level) of the CompactFlash card. 
You won’’t be able to import the files into the SP-
555 if they’re anywhere other than the root 
directory.
• A maximum of 160 audio files can be handled 
when importing. If more than this number of 
audio files are on the CompactFlash card, 
unexpected operation may occur.
• You can’t use the “.” (period) character at the 
beginning of a file name. Nor can certain other 
characters (\ / : , : * ? “ < > |) be used in a file 
name.
• The extension of a WAV file must be WAV, and 
the extension of an AIFF file must be AIF. The file 
will not be recognized if its name has any other 
extension.
• The audio files will be imported in the ASCII code 
order of their file names.
• 8-bit and 16-bit are the only sample depths 
supported.
• Sample rate conversion will not be performed. 
The data will be imported as if it had a sample 
rate of 44.1 kHz. If you import a file whose 
actual sample rate is other than 44.1 kHz, the 
playback pitch will be incorrect.
• Loop point settings in an AIFF file will be ignored.
• If you attempt to import a WAV/AIFF file whose 
format is not supported by the SP-555, the error 
message “UnS” (Unsupported) will appear, and 
you won’t be able to import the file.
• Compressed audio files cannot be imported.
• In some cases, it may not be possible to import 
audio files of an extremely short duration.
• Importing will take approximately half as long as 
the playback time of the audio file.
• Once you start the import process, you cannot 
cancel it before completion.

About V-LINK
 
V-LINK ( ) is functionality promoted by 
Roland that makes it easy to synchronize visual effects with 
music. By using video equipment that supports the use of V-
LINK (such as Edirol motion dive .tokyo Performance 
Package), you can easily produce a variety of visual effects 
that are linked to the expressive elements of your 
performance.
For example, if you use the SP-555 in conjunction with the 
motion dive .tokyo Performance Package, you’ll be able to 
do the following.
• Use the SP-555’s synthesizer to produce synchronized 
music and video performances.
• Play the SP-555’s pads or sequencer (songs or 
patterns) to switch images on the motion dive .tokyo 
Performance Package.
• Use the SP-555’s CTRL 1–3 knobs and D Beam 
controller to control the brightness or hue of an image.
 
In order to use V-LINK between the SP-555 and the motion 
dive .tokyo Performance Package, you’ll need to make 
connections using a MIDI cable (sold separately).
 
As an example, we will use a setup in which the SP-555 is 
connected to the motion dive .tokyo Performance Package. 
Use a MIDI cable to connect the SP-555’s MIDI OUT 
connector to the MIDI IN connector of the Edirol MD-P1.
 
To prevent malfunction or speaker damage, minimize the 
volume on all your equipment and turn off the power before 
you make connections.
 
1.
 
Press the SP-555’s [V-LINK] button so it’s lit; V-LINK 
will be on.
 
When [V-LINK] is lit, you can operate the SP-555 to 
control images in synchronization with the SP-555’s 
performance.
 
2.
 
To turn off V-LINK, press [V-LINK] once again so its 
light goes out.
 
* For details on how to change these functions, refer to 
 
“V-LINK 
settings”
 
 (p. 53).

: The depth of these parameters will be limited if you turn on 
 
“Effect Limit mode”
 
 (p. 20).
* For FLANGER and PHASER, you can use [MFX] + CTRL 1 knob to adjust the volume balance between the direct sound and effect sound.
*1: You can select the following patterns by turning the CTRL knob.
The TIMING PTN interval will synchronize to the tempo of the longest sample of the samples to which the effect is being applied. However, 
if a pattern is playing, the interval will synchronize to the tempo of the pattern.
You can use RATE to adjust the synchronization speed as follows.
RATE maximum (turn the CTRL 2 knob all the way to the right): One cycle of TIMING PTN corresponds to one measure.
RATE minimum (turn the CTRL 2 knob all the way to the left): One cycle of TIMING PTN corresponds to a 32nd note.
By turning the CTRL 2 knob you can change this to any value from a 32nd note up to one measure.
*2: RATE is specified as a note value relative to the tempo of the longest sample of the samples to which the effect is being applied.
Note values that you can specify:
32nd note (t32) / 16th note (t16) / 8th note triplet (t8t) / dotted 16th note (t16.) / 8th note (t8) / quarter note triplet (t4t) / dotted 8th 
note (t8.) / quarter note (t4) / half note triplet (t2t) / dotted quarter note (t4.) / half note (t2) / dotted half note (t2.) / whole note (t1)
If a pattern is playing, the tempo of the pattern is used as the reference. If a pattern is playing, or if 
 
“Effect tempo mode”
 
 (p. 20) is set 
to synchronize to the tempo of the pattern sequencer, the tempo of the pattern is used as the reference.

note (t8.) / quarter note (t4) / half note triplet (t2t) / dotted quarter note (t4.) / half note (t2) / dotted half note (t2.) / whole note (t1)
If a pattern is playing, the tempo of the pattern is used as the reference. If a pattern is playing or if 
 
“Effect tempo mode”
 
 (p. 20) has 
been set to synchronize to the tempo of the pattern sequencer, the tempo of the pattern is also used as the reference.
*2: Turn the CTRL 3 balance toward 12 o’clock, turn the CTRL 1 pitch all the way to the right, and use CTRL 2 to adjust the threshold so that the 
sine wave is sounded appropriately according to the input source. When you’ve finished setting the threshold, adjust the pitch and balance. 
This is a convenient way to supplement the kick drum.

Appendix
 
This section lists some items to check and actions to take if 
you experience problems. Refer to the section appropriate 
for your situation.
 
Has the power to the SP-555 and your connected 
equipment been turned on?
Are the SP-555 and your external equipment connected 
correctly?
 
Check the connections.
 
Could an audio cable be broken?
Could you be using an audio cable that contains a built-in 
resistor?
 
Use a connection cable that does not contain a built-in 
resistor (such as one from the Roland PCS series).
 
Could the volume of the connected amp or mixer be turned 
down?
 
Adjust the volume to an appropriate level.
 
Could the SP-555’s volume be lowered?
 
Adjust the volume to an appropriate level.
 
Check whether you hear sound in your headphones.
 
If you hear sound in your headphones, the connection cable 
may be broken, or there may be a problem with the 
connected amp or mixer. Check the connections and the 
connected equipment.
 
If you’re using a CompactFlash card, is the card inserted 
correctly?
 
Check the CompactFlash card.
 
If you’re attempting to play a sample, is its pad lit?
 
The sample will play when you press a lit pad. No sample is 
assigned to a pad that is unlit.
 
Could the sample level be lowered?
 
Adjust the level of the sample. (p. 28)
 
Could the effect level be lowered?
 
For some effect types, the level can be adjusted by a control 
knob. For details on effect types and the control knob 
assignments, refer to 
 
“Effect list”
 
 (p. 54).
 
Is [LINE IN] lit?
 
To play sounds from the line input, press [LINE IN] so it’s lit.
 
Could the external input level be lowered?
 
Turn the LINE IN LEVEL knob to adjust the level 
appropriately. (p. 22)
 
Could the volume of the device connected to LINE IN be 
lowered?
 
Adjust the level appropriately.
 
Is the audio cable connected correctly?
 
Check the connection.
 
Could the audio cable be broken?
Could you be using an audio cable that contains a built-in 
resistor?
 
Use a connection cable that does not contain a built-in 
resistor (such as the Roland PCS series).
 
Is [MIC] lit?
 
To play sound from the mic input, press [MIC] to make the 
pad light.
 
Could the external input level be lowered?
 
Turn the MIC knob to adjust the level appropriately.
 
Is the mic cable connected correctly?
 
Check the connections.
 
Could the mic cable be broken?
The MIC volume can’t be turned down to zero
 
If you’re not using the mic, turn [MIC] off.
 
Troubleshooting
 
No sound / Insufficient volume
No sound or insufficient volume from 
equipment connected to LINE IN
No sound or insufficient volume from a 
mic
The mic picks up noise

Appendix
 
Could there be insufficient memory?
 
If there is insufficient memory, the display will indicate “FUL” 
(Memory Full) when you attempt to sample. Delete unneeded 
samples to increase the amount of free memory. (p. 23)
 
Is the CompactFlash card inserted correctly?
 
If you’re sampling to sample banks C–J, make sure that the 
CompactFlash card is inserted correctly. (p. 45)
 
Is the CompactFlash card formatted correctly?
 
Format the CompactFlash card using the SP-555. (p. 45)
 
Are samples assigned to all pads?
 
You can’t sample if there are no vacant pads. Delete 
unwanted samples to free up some pads. (p. 23)
 
Could [PATTERN SELECT] be lit?
 
If [PATTERN SELECT] is lit, you’re recording patterns, and 
will not be able to sample.
Press [PATTERN SELECT] so its light is turned off.
 
Could [DEL] be lit or blinking?
 
If [DEL] is lit or blinking, you are deleting samples, and will 
not be able to sample.
 
Is the input level appropriate?
 
The sampled sound will be distorted if the input level is too 
high, and if the level is too low there will be excessive noise. 
Adjust the level so that the PEAK indicator lights 
occasionally.
 
Are the effect settings appropriate?
 
Some types of effect will make the level higher than the 
original sample, or may distort the sound itself. Some effects 
also emphasize the noise. Try turning the effect off, and 
check whether the noise or distortion is present in the original 
sample itself. Then adjust the effect settings appropriately.
 
Could you be playing more than one sample 
simultaneously?
 
Even if the level of each sample is appropriate, playing 
multiple samples simultaneously will raise the overall level 
excessively, possibly causing distortion. Lower the level of 
each sample to avoid distortion.
 
Did you save at an appropriate level?
 
When you overdub repeatedly, the phrase level may 
increase, causing distortion when you save it to a pad. 
Adjust the level when saving the sound to a pad. (p. 27)
 
Is the CompactFlash card inserted correctly?
 
Check the CompactFlash card. (p. 45)
 
Is the CompactFlash card an appropriate type?
 
You can use CompactFlash cards with a capacity between 
32 MB and 2 GB. Other cards cannot be used. (p. 44)
 
Is the CompactFlash card formatted correctly?
 
CompactFlash cards formatted by a device other than the SP-
555 cannot be used. Please format the CompactFlash card. 
(p. 45)
 
It is possible that the power was turned off while data 
was being written into internal memory (i.e., while the 
dot was blinking in the display). The lost data cannot 
be recovered.
 
In this case, it is possible that all data in internal memory has 
been destroyed. Additional malfunctions may occur if you 
attempt to continue using the SP-555. Please initialize the 
internal memory. (p. 50).
 
* When you initialize the memory, all data in internal memory 
will be lost.

cannot be recovered.
 
In this case, it is possible that all data in the CompactFlash 
card has been destroyed. Additional malfunctions may occur 
if you attempt to continue using the card. Please format the 
CompactFlash card. (p. 45).
 
* When you format the CompactFlash card, all data in the card 
will be lost.
 
Have you made the correct settings so that the pattern 
sequencer can synchronize?
 
Check the settings. (p. 69)
 
Is the external MIDI device set to transmit MIDI clock 
messages?
 
Some devices have a setting that turns MIDI clock 
transmission on/off. Also, some external devices, such as 
sequencers, transmit MIDI clock only during playback.
 
Does the tempo of the external MIDI device exceed the 
tempo range to which the SP-555 is able to synchronize?
 
The SP-555 can synchronize to a tempo in the 40–200 
range. It may be unable to synchronize to a tempo that is 
outside this range.
 
Data is not saved correctly in the 
CompactFlash card
Pattern sequencer does not synchronize

If you connect a pedal switch (DP series; sold separately) to the rear panel PEDAL jack, you’ll be able to perform the following 
operations by pressing the pedal.
 
1.
 
Using the screws located on the bottom of the SP-555, 
attach the stand holder of the PDS-10 pad stand (sold 
separately) as shown in the illustration.
 
* You must use these screws. Using any other screws will cause 
malfunctions.
 
When turning the unit upside-down, get a bunch of 
newspapers or magazines, and place them under the four 
corners or at both ends to prevent damage to the buttons and 
controls. Also, you should try to orient the unit so no buttons or 
controls get damaged.
 
When turning the unit upside-down, handle with care to avoid 
dropping it, or allowing it to fall or tip over.
 
2.
 
Attach the SP-555 to the PDS-10 pad stand.
 
For details on assembling the pad stand or attaching the 
stand holder, refer to the owner’s manual of the pad 
stand.
 
If you attach the SP-555 to the PDS-10, you must spread the 
legs of the PDS-10 to their full extent. You must set up the stand 
so that the total height including the SP-555 itself does not 
exceed one meter.
This stand for use only with specific Roland musical 
instruments. See apparatus instructions. Use with other 
models is capable of resulting in instability causing possible 
injury.

Using the SP-555 with other MIDI equipment
 
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, and is a 
global standard that allows electronic musical instruments 
and computers to exchange performance data. The SP-555 
is compatible with MIDI, and provides two MIDI connectors, 
MIDI IN and MIDI OUT. By connecting these connectors to 
other MIDI devices you can create a wide range of setups.
 
“MIDI Implementation”
 
 (p. 72) is a chart that provides an 
easy way of checking which MIDI messages the SP-555 is 
able to receive. By comparing the MIDI implementation charts 
of the SP-555 and some other MIDI device, you can see which 
messages are compatible between the two devices.
 
1.
 
While holding down [TIME/BPM], turn on the power.
 
2.
 
Press bank [A].
 
The display will indicate “Mod,” and then the MIDI 
synchronization mode will be displayed. 
Synchronization will operate according to the MIDI 
synchronization mode.
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 knob to select the MIDI synchronization 
mode.
 
With the factory settings this is set to “Aut.”
 
4.
 
Press [SAMPLING] so its light is turned off.
 
This completes the MIDI synchronization mode setting.
 
This setting will not change when you turn off the power.
 
About MIDI
Synchronizing the SP-555 
with another MIDI device
 
MIDI synchroni-
zation mode
Explanation
 
“Aut”
(Auto Sync)
When MIDI clock is received, the SP-555 will au-
tomatically synchronize its own tempo to it. If 
MIDI start/stop/continue messages are received, 
the pattern will start/stop playing.
* MIDI start/stop/continue will not be received 
during pattern recording.
“tMp”
(Tempo Sync)
When MIDI clock is received, the SP-555 will au-
tomatically synchronize its own tempo to it. MIDI 
start/stop/continue messages will not be re-
ceived.
* Select this mode of operation if you want to 
play the SP-555’s patterns later at the desired 
timing in synchronization with the perfor-
mance of your external MIDI sequencer, so 
that the two performances do not begin at the 
same time.
“oFF”
(Sync OFF)
MIDI clock and start/stop/continue messages 
will not be received.
* Select this mode of operation if you only want 
to play the SP-555’s samples using note mes-
sages sent by your external MIDI sequencer.

Using the SP-555 with other MIDI equipment
 
With the factory settings, the SP-555 (whose MIDI 
synchronization mode will be set to “Aut”) can be connected 
to your external MIDI sequencer, and the external MIDI 
sequencer can control the start/stop and tempo of the 
pattern playback.
 
1.
 
Use a MIDI cable to connect your external MIDI 
sequencer’s MIDI OUT connector to the SP-555’s MIDI 
IN connector.
 
2.
 
Press [PATTERN SELECT] so the button is lit.
 
3.
 
Press a BANK [A]–[F/J] button to select the bank of the 
pattern you want to play.
 
To select a pattern bank G–J, press BANK [C/G]–[F/J] 
once again so the button is blinking.
 
If no CompactFlash card is inserted, you won’t be able to 
select pattern banks C–J.
 
4.
 
While holding down [HOLD], press the pad of the 
pattern you want to play.
 
The pad of the specified pattern will light.
 
If you simply press the pad without pressing [HOLD], the 
pattern will begin playing immediately.
 
5.
 
Start your external MIDI sequencer.
 
The specified pattern will begin playing in 
synchronization with your external MIDI sequencer.
The pattern tempo will synchronize to the tempo of your 
external MIDI sequencer.
 
6.
 
When you stop your external MIDI sequencer, the 
pattern will stop playing.
 
If the pattern playback does not start when you start your 
external MIDI sequencer, or if the tempo does not synchronize 
to your external MIDI sequencer, it is possible that your 
external MIDI sequencer is not transmitting MIDI clock or start/
continue/stop messages.
 
Refer to the owner’s manual of your external MIDI 
sequencer and check its settings.
If you make this setting, the SP-555’s MIDI IN connector will 
transmit timing clock in synchronization with the pattern 
tempo, as well as synchronization-related MIDI messages 
(start, stop, continue).
 
If the SP-555 is synchronized to an external MIDI device, it will 
not transmit timing clock or synchronization-related MIDI 
messages.
 
1.
 
While holding down [TIME/BPM], switch on the SP-
555’s power.
 
2.
 
Press BANK [C].
 
The display will indicate “tH.”
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 knob to turn MIDI clock transmission 
on/off.
 
If you turn this “on,” synchronization messages will be 
transmitted from the MIDI OUT connector and from the 
USB’s MIDI OUT.
 
4.
 
Press [SAMPLING] to save the setting.
 
In order to synchronize an external MIDI device to the SP-555, 
the MIDI device must be set to follow these synchronization 
messages. For details on these settings and how to make them, 
refer to the owner’s manual for your MIDI device.

Using the SP-555 with other MIDI equipment
 
Use the following MIDI channels and note numbers when 
playing the SP-555’s samples from an external MIDI device, 
or when using the SP-555’s pads to play an external MIDI 
device.
 
1.
 
While holding down [PATTERN SELECT], switch on the 
SP-555’s power.
 
2.
 
Press BANK [A].
 
The display will indicate “C.1.”
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 knob to specify the MIDI channel.
 
4.
 
Press [SAMPLING] to save the setting.
 
You can’t change the MIDI channel used for transmission by 
the pattern sequencer. The pattern sequencer always operates 
under the assumption that Pad Base Ch. = 1.
 
1.
 
While holding down [PATTERN SELECT], switch on the 
SP-555’’s power.
 
2.
 
Press BANK [B].
 
The display will indicate “trU.”
 
3.
 
Turn the CTRL 3 knob to turn MIDI Thru on/off.
 
If this is “on,” MIDI messages received at the MIDI IN 
connector or the USB MIDI input will be retransmitted 
(“thru-ed”) from the MIDI OUT connector.
MIDI messages from the MIDI IN connector will be “thru-
ed” to the USB MIDI output.
The “thru-ed” MIDI messages will be merged with the 
pad performance and pattern sequencer performance, 
and sent to each MIDI output.
 
4.
 
Press [SAMPLING] to save the setting.
