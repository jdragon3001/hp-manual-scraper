ATARI 800 COMPUTER

THE COMPUTER
MEMORY

Memory makes it possible for a
computer to store information
which can be recalled when
necessary. The amount of
memory in a computer is what
determines how much data can
be stored. Your ATARI 800 Home
Computer comes with one ATARI
Memory Module™. However.
your computer's memory can be
expanded by purchasing addi-
tional ATARI Memory Modules
from your ATARI Computer
retailer

THE CARTRIDGE

Many programming languages
games, and applications come in
the form of a cartridge. These
cartridges contain the actual pro-
gram or programming informa-
tion required to perform the
desired functions

The programming language
cartridges contain the instruc-
tions and other types of code
making up that particular
language. When you write a pro-
gram, you are organizing these
instructions into a meaningful
procedure that the computer can
understand and then execute.

USE WITH CONSOLE KEYBOARD.

The game cartridges contain the
entire program for that game. To
begin playing the game, all you
need to do is insert the cartridge,
turn on the television, make sure
the TV Switch Box is on COM-

computer. Then follow the game
directions and have fun!

Now that you have had a chance
to become familiar with your
computer system, let's do some
simple programs for fun. The
programs listed are written in
ATARI BASIC, and will give you
an idea of some of the things you
can do. To learn more about pro:
gramming your ATARI 800 Com-
puter in ATARI BASIC, please
refer to your ATARI BASIC Self-
Teaching Guide. Then use your
ATARI BASIC Reference Manual
as you become more familiar
with the language

typing in a line of your program,
press the key until
you delete the error. Then type
the correction and continue. You
can go back to an error by

EXPANDING YOUR
ATARI 800 HOME
COMPUTER SYSTEM

One of the features of your
ATARI 800 Home Computer is

its expandability. You can add a
printer, a program recorder, and
disk drives. Each piece of ATARI
Computer equipment is made
specifically for your ATARI Com-
puter, connects easily to the rest
of your system, and has the con-
sistent quality you have come to
expect from Atari. You can also
add a large family of other
peripheral equipment, such as a
modem, digitizer, plotter, sensor,
or controllers

Your ATARI 800 Computer
comes with a 10K ROM (Read-
Only Memory) module, which is
part of the Operating System
The ROM is like the conductor of
an orchestra, directing every
part of your system—telling it
what to do and when to perform
Some of the ROM module's
specific functions are performing
arithmetic calculations and
generating the different colors,
along with the letters you see on
the screen.

ADDING MORE
MEMORY

Your computer also comes with a
16K RAM (Random Access
Memory) ATARI Memory
Module. This means it can hold
16,000 characters of information.
However, your system can be
expanded to hold 48K RAM,
which stores up to 48,000
characters of information

The memory modules are
located under the nbbed section
of the console cover, and the
following steps show you how to
insert additional memory
modules into your ATARI 800
Home Computer

Open the cartridge door as if
you were going to insert a
cartridge

Rotate the black latches

located above the cartridge
slot in the direction of the arrows
as shown

Carefully remove the ribbed

cover from the computer.
You will see a 1OK ROM module
and one 16K RAM module
already inserted

--- Page 16 ---
Position your new memory

module directly behind the
existing 16K RAM module and
push it firmly into place

Place the cover back into

position, making sure you
match up the notches on the
lower back section of the cover
and the cover housing

When the cover is in place,
press down on it with one
hand, and move the latches back
into the locking position with the
other hand. If the latches do not
lock without force, remove and

reposition the cover

PRINTERS.

You may eventually require a
printer to obtain a copy of pro-
grams or data. This might be the
case when using programs such
as the Personal Financial
Management System™,
Biorhythm, Dow Jones* Invest-
ment Evaluator™, Mailing List, or
programs you write yourself.
Atari has three printers available
which can be easily connected to
your computer.

STORAGE
DEVICES

The computer runs programs
from its RAM, and the RAM re-
tains programs only as long as
the computer's power is on. If
you want to store programs or
data, you do so on cassette tape
or diskette; then, when you want
to use the programs, you simply
LOAD them into RAM and tell
the computer to RUN them. Some
ATARI Computer programs are
available on ROM cartridges,
which are faster and easier to
load, but also more expensive.
Atari makes two program storage
devices.

ATARI 410™
PROGRAM RECORDER

The ATARI 410 Program Record-
er is an economical way to add
storage capacity to your com-
puter system, It attaches easily
and directly to your computer
console, or to any other ATARI
Computer peripherals you may
have.

ATARI 810™
DISK DRIVE

The ATARI 810 Disk Drive adds
fast, reliable storage capability.
Your files can be stored by
name, and are more accessible
when you want them.

Up to four disk drives can be at-
tached to your ATARI 800 Home
Computer. Each unit is capable
of storing 88K (88,000 characters)
of information on standard, 5 1/4-
inch floppy diskettes.

GAME ACCESSORIES AND
ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE

Accessories, such as joy-sticks
and paddles, which are required
by some of the ATARI Computer
games and programs, are
available from your ATARI Com-
puter retailer.

Please check the ATARI Home
Computer Product Catalog, also
available at your ATARI Com-
puter retailer, for our full line of
programming languages, home
study, home office, and
home entertainment pro-
grams and accessories.
