qualiÀed personnel only.
1.1 Precautions
  Do not use the SMART All-in-One near 
water, e.g. near a bathtub, washbowl, 
kitchen sink, laundry tub, swimming pool or 
in a wet basement.
  Do not place the SMART All-in-One 
on an unstable cart, stand, or table. If 
the SMART All-in-One falls, it can injure 
a person and cause serious damage to 
the appliance. Use only a cart or stand 
recommended by the manufacturer or sold 
with the SMART All-in-One.
  Slots and openings in the back and 
bottom of the cabinet are provided for 
ventilation. To ensure reliable operation of 
the SMART All-in-One and to protect it 
from overheating, be sure these openings 
are not blocked or covered. Do not 
place the SMART All-in-One on a bed, 
sofa, rug, or similar surface. Do not place 
the SMART All-in-One near or over a 
radiator or heat register. Do not place 
the SMART All-in-One in a bookcase 
or cabinet unless proper ventilation is 
provided.
  The SMART All-in-One should be 
operated only from the type of power 
source indicated on the label. If you are not 
sure of the type of power supplied to your 
home, consult your dealer or local power 
company.

. For your safety
  The SMART All-in-One is equipped with 
a three-pronged grounded plug, a plug 
with a third (grounding) pin. This plug will 
fit only into a grounded power outlet as 
a safety feature. If your outlet does not 
accommodate the three-wire plug, have an 
electrician install the correct outlet, or use 
an adapter to ground the appliance safely. 
Do not defeat the safety purpose of the 
grounded plug.
  Unplug the unit during a lightening 
storm or when it will not be used for 
long period of time. This will protect the 
SMART All-in-One from damage due to 
power surges.
  Do not overload power strips and 
extension cords. Overloading can result in 
fire or electric shock.
  Never push any object into the slot 
on the SMART All-in-One cabinet. It 
could short circuit parts causing a fire or 
electric shock. Never spill liquids on the 
SMART All-in-One.
  Do not attempt to service the 
SMART All-in-One by yourself; opening 
or removing covers can expose you to 
dangerous voltages and other hazards. 
Please refer all servicing to qualified service 
personnel.
  To ensure satisfactory operation, use 
the SMART All-in-One only with UL 
listed computers which have appropriate 
configured receptacles marked between 
100 - 240V AC, Min. 5A.
  The wall socket shall be installed near the 
equipment and shall be easily accessible.
  For use only with the attached power 
adapter (Output 19V DC) which have UL, 
CSA listed licensed (only for monitor with 
power adapter).

Manufacturer:    SHENZHZEN HONOR 
ELECTRONIC CO., LTD.
1.2 Cleaning
  Clean the cabinet regularly with cloth. You 
can use soft-detergent to wipe out the 
stain, instead of strong-detergent which will 
cauterize the product cabinet.
  When cleaning, make sure no detergent is 
leaked into the product. The cleaning cloth 
should not be too rough as it will scratch 
the screen surface.
  Please disconnect the power cord before 
cleaning the product.
1.3  Special notes on 
SMART All-in-One
The following symptoms are normal with 
SMART All-in-One and do not indicate a 
problem.
  Note
  Due to the nature of the fluorescent light, 
the screen may flicker during initial use. Turn 
off the Power Switch and then turn it on 
again to make sure the flicker disappears.
  You may find slightly uneven brightness 
on the screen depending on the desktop 
pattern you use.
  The LCD screen has effective pixels of 
99.99% or more. It may include blemishes 
of 0.01% or less such as a missing pixel or a 
pixel lit all of the time.
  Due to the nature of the LCD screen, an 
afterimage of the previous screen may 
remain after switching the image when the 
same image has been displayed for a long 
time. The SMART All-in-One will slowly 
recover from this.
  When the screen becomes black or 
flashing, or cannot illuminate any more, 
contact your dealer or service center to 
replace parts. Don’t repair the screen by 
yourself!

6.1  Philips’ Flat Panel Monitors Pixel 
Defect Policy
Philips strives to deliver the highest quality 
products. We use some of the industry's most 
advanced manufacturing processes and practice 
stringent quality control. However, pixel or 
sub pixel defects on the TFT Monitor panels 
used in Áat panel monitors are sometimes 
unavoidable. No manufacturer can guarantee 
that all panels will be free from pixel defects, 
but Philips guarantees that any monitor with an 
unacceptable number of defects will be repaired 
or replaced under warranty. This notice explains 
the different types of pixel defects and deÀnes 
acceptable defect levels for each type. In order 
to qualify for repair or replacement under 
warranty, the number of pixel defects on a TFT 
Monitor panel must exceed these acceptable 
levels. For example, no more than 0.0004% of 
the sub pixels on a monitor may be defective. 
Furthermore, Philips sets even higher quality 
standards for certain types or combinations 
of pixel defects that are more noticeable than 
others. This policy is valid worldwide.

Pixels and Sub pixels 
A pixel, or picture element, is composed of 
three sub pixels in the primary colors of red, 
green and blue. Many pixels together form an 
image. When all sub pixels of a pixel are lit, the 
three colored sub pixels together appear as a 
single white pixel. When all are dark, the three 
colored sub pixels together appear as a single 
black pixel. Other combinations of lit and dark 
sub pixels appear as single pixels of other colors.
Types of Pixel Defects 
Pixel and sub pixel defects appear on the screen 
in different ways. There are two categories of 
pixel defects and several types of sub pixel 
defects within each category. 
Bright Dot Defects
Bright dot defects appear as pixels or sub pixels 
that are always lit or 'on'. That is, a bright dot is 
a sub-pixel that stands out on the screen when 
the monitor displays a dark pattern. There are 
the types of bright dot defects.
One lit red, green or blue sub pixel.

. Customer care and warranty
Two adjacent lit sub pixels:
-  Red + Blue = Purple
-   Red + Green = Yellow
-   Green + Blue = Cyan (Light Blue)
Three adjacent lit sub pixels (one white pixel).
 Note
A red or blue bright dot must be more 
than 50 
percent brighter than neighboring dots while 
a green bright dot is 30 percent brighter than 
neighboring dots.
Black Dot Defects 
Black dot defects appear as pixels or sub pixels 
that are always dark or 'off'. That is, a dark dot is 
a sub-pixel that stands out on the screen when 
the monitor displays a light pattern. These are 
the types of black dot defects.
Proximity of Pixel Defects 
Because pixel and sub pixels defects of the 
same type that are near to one another may be 
more noticeable, Philips also speciÀes tolerances 
for the proximity of pixel defects.
