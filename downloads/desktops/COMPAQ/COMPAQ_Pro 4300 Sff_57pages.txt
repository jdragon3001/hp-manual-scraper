Introduction
:
HP Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) Hard Drives maximize the performance of HP Business PCs by providing the
technologies to meet your increasing storage demands with high-capacity drives offering superior reliability and performance.
SATA provides faster data transfer speeds, better system cooling airflow, more bandwidth, more headroom for speed increases in
future generations and better data integrity. A next-generation technology, the SATA interface connects hard drives to the PC platform
enabling easy aggregation of multiple hard drives into a single PC. This offers you the additional benefits of dedicated bandwidth, the
ability to more easily identify device failures and scalability. The HP Compaq Pro 4300 Series supports the latest SATA 6.0 Gb/s
specification.
HP Drive Lock
HP Serial ATA Hard Drives offer enhanced security via a new Drive Lock. When enabled, this ATA security feature set prevents software
access to user data on the drive until one or two user-defined passwords are provided.
SMART IV Technology
Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) hard drive technology allows hard drives to monitor their own health and
to raise flags if imminent failures are predicted. If the drive determines that a failure is imminent, the SMART hard drive technology
enables the intelligent manageability or management software to generate a fault alert. While the current versions of SMART hard
drives do a good job monitoring the data on the hard drive media, the ever increasing emphasis on reliability and quality has promoted
HP to implement SMART IV technology which constantly checks that the data flow from host interface to media and media to host
interface is not compromised. This is accomplished by inserting a 2 byte parity code into every 512 byte block in the data path of the
hard drive's Cache RAM. This unique parity checking performed by HP's SMART IV technology hard drives, allows for more complete
error detection coverage encompassing the entire data path between the host and the hard drive.
Smart IV is also known as IOEDC: I/O Error Detection Code.
Native Command Queuing
NCQ or Native Command Queuing is a SATA protocol extension that allows the hard drive to have several write or read commands
outstanding at the same time. In contrast, normal non-queued operation requires each command to be completed before the next
command is issued by the host system. Queuing allows the drive to complete the commands in the order that allows for best overall
throughput. It also involves an advanced method of transferring data to or from the host, called First Party Direct Memory Access
(FPDMA), which allows the hard drive and the host controller to manage the data transfers for multiple outstanding commands, without
involving the host processor. NCQ can contribute to better performance but the results are dependent on many factors, including the
access patterns of the various applications and operating system functions that are initiating drive accesses. Enabling NCQ features in
the hard drive requires AHCI support from the host system BIOS, controller, and driver. AHCI support is typically implemented in RAID
configurations.
Note:
 GB = 1 billion bytes. Actual available capacity is less.

System Memory Support
Memory upgrades are accomplished by adding single or multiple DIMMs of the same or varied sizes. This chart does not represent all
possible memory configurations. The HP Compaq Pro 4300 Series PC supports non-ECC DDR3 memory with a data rate of 1600 MHz
(limited to 1333 MHz due to chipset)
CAUTION: 
You must shut down the computer and disconnect the power cord before adding or removing memory modules. Regardless
of the power-on state, voltage is always supplied to the memory modules as long as the computer is plugged in to an active AC outlet.
Adding or removing memory modules while voltage is present may cause irreparable damage to the memory modules or system board.
Memory Configurations:
Supports up to 16 GB of DDR3 SDRAM using DIMM modules. Slot 1 is black and must always be populated. Not all memory
configurations possible are represented below.
NOTE: 
For systems configured with more than 3 GB of memory and a 32-bit operating system, all memory may not be available due to
system resource requirements. Addressing memory above 4 GB requires a 64-bit operating system.

HP USB PS/2 Washable Keyboard
Introduction
:
The HP USB PS2 Washable Keyboard is well-suited for environments that require keyboards to be immersed and cleaned with the
following solvents: soap, washing-up liquid, non-abrasive cleaners, general purpose cleaners, bleach, disinfectant, antibacterial
cleaners and surgical spirit. The HP USB PS2 Washable Keyboard provides protection against ingress of water and dust to code IP66
defined in IEC (International Electro Technical Commission) standard 60529-1 and code 4X as defined in NEMA (National Electrical
Manufacturers Association) standard 250. The code IP66 defined in the IEC standard 60529 means the keyboard is protected against
the ingress of dust, and that high pressure water jets from any direction will not have any harmful effects. A NEMA 4X enclosure as
defined in NEMA standard 250 will provide protection against windblown dust, rain, splashing water and hose directed water. For
additional information on regulatory standards consult your legal department.
NOTE: 
Observe the manufacturer's instructions for the preparation and use of all cleaning fluids and wear the appropriate protective
clothing.

HP USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard
Introduction
:
Boost your security, simplify access procedures and reduce the costs associated with managing networks by preventing unauthorized
access to your computers and networks using smartcard technology with the HP Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard.
The USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard is a full-sized keyboard that takes advantage of digital signatures and certificates to secure the
environment for transactions performed on both public and private networks. The USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard works with all
smart cards that comply with ISO standard 7816.
Smart cards are easy-to-use credit card-sized devices which require multiple forms of information to be validated before you gain
access to your accounts or resources. Used worldwide, smart cards strengthen access to a network or other resource using dual-factor
authentication. Implementing a two-factor authentication (or multi-factor authentication) process reduces the risk of unauthorized
access by verifying and validating your identity in one of the following ways:
Something you know – a combination of username and password or PIN
Something you have – a smart card or security token.
Something you have (smart card) plus something you know (PIN), improves user-access security within corporate network
environments. Smart cards are used in government agencies, healthcare companies and the finance industry.
HP Client Security Smart Card Manager provides authentication software for the smart card. The Smart Card Reader module works with
the HP Client Security Manager and enables the user to setup, use, and manage the smart card. This allows strengthened security with
HP patented technology.
Key Benefits:
Protects against unauthorized access with smart card technology
Delivers even greater security when combined with a HP Client Security smart card and the HP
Client Security Software
Combination of username and password or pin with a smart card or security token
Secures online transactions using digital signatures and certificates
Conforms to industry standards for ease of setup and use
Delivers long product life and quiet operation with high-impact materials and lubricated keys

Unit Environment and Operating Conditions
General Unit Operating Guidelines
Keep the computer away from excessive moisture, direct moisture and the extremes of heat and cold, to ensure that unit is
operated within the specified operating range.
Leave a 10.2 cm (4 in) clearance on all vented sides of the computer to permit the required airflow.
Never restrict airflow into the computer by blocking any vents or air intakes.
Do not stack computers on top of each other or place computers so near each other that they are subject to each other's re-
circulated or preheated air.
Occasionally clean the air vents on the front, back, and any other vented side of the computer. Lint, dust and other foreign
matter can block the vents and limit the airflow.
If the computer is to be operated within a separate enclosure, intake and exhaust ventilation must be provided on the enclosure,
and the same operating guidelines listed above will still apply.

prevents software access to user data on the drive until one or two user-defined
passwords are provided.
Drive Protection System
DPS Access through F10 Setup during Boot
A diagnostic hard drive self test. It scans critical physical components and every sector of
the hard drive for physical faults and then reports any faults to the user

Drive Protection System
Running independently of the operating system, it can be accessed through a Windows-
based diagnostics utility or through the computer's setup procedure. It produces an
evaluation on whether the hard drive is the source of the problem and needs to be
replaced
The system expands on the Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology
(SMART), a continuously running systems diagnostic that alerts the user to certain types
of failures
SMART Technology (Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technology)
SMART I - Drive Failure Prediction
SMART II - Off-Line Data Collection
SMART III - Off-Line Read Scanning with
Defect Reallocation
SMART IV - End-to-End CRC for hard drives
Allows hard drives to monitor their own health and to raise flags if imminent failures were
predicted
Predicts failures before they occur. Tracks fault prediction and failure indication
parameters such as re-allocated sector count, spin retry count, calibration retry count
By avoiding actual hard drive failures, SMART hard drives act as "insurance" against
unplanned user downtime and potential data loss from hard drive failure
IOEDC: I/O Error Detection Circuitry
Detects errors in Read/Write buffers on HDD cache RAM
Interface in F10 setup provides confirmation of SMART IV support.
