Introduction
:
HP Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) Hard Drives maximize the performance of HP Business PCs by providing the
technologies to meet your increasing storage demands with high-capacity drives offering superior reliability and performance.
SATA provides faster data transfer speeds, better system cooling airflow, more bandwidth, more headroom for speed increases in
future generations and better data integrity. A next-generation technology, the SATA interface connects hard drives to the PC platform
enabling easy aggregation of multiple hard drives into a single PC. This offers you the additional benefits of dedicated bandwidth, the
ability to more easily identify device failures and scalability. The HP Compaq 6300 Pro Series supports the latest SATA 6.0Gb/s
specification.
HP Drive Lock
HP Serial ATA Hard Drives offer enhanced security via a new Drive Lock. When enabled, this ATA security feature set prevents software
access to user data on the drive until one or two user-defined passwords are provided.
SMART IV Technology
Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) hard drive technology allows hard drives to monitor their own health and
to raise flags if imminent failures are predicted. If the drive determines that a failure is imminent, the SMART hard drive technology
enables the intelligent manageability or management software to generate a fault alert. While the current versions of SMART hard
drives do a good job monitoring the data on the hard drive media, the ever increasing emphasis on reliability and quality has promoted
HP to implement SMART IV technology which constantly checks that the data flow from host interface to media and media to host
interface is not compromised. This is accomplished by inserting a 2 byte parity code into every 512 byte block in the data path of the
hard drive's Cache RAM. This unique parity checking performed by HP's SMART IV technology hard drives, allows for more complete
error detection coverage encompassing the entire data path between the host and the hard drive.
Smart IV is also known as IOEDC: I/O Error Detection Code.
Native Command Queuing
NCQ or Native Command Queuing is a SATA protocol extension that allows the hard drive to have several write or read commands
outstanding at the same time. In contrast, normal non-queued operation requires each command to be completed before the next
command is issued by the host system. Queuing allows the drive to complete the commands in the order that allows for best overall
throughput. It also involves an advanced method of transferring data to or from the host, called First Party Direct Memory Access
(FPDMA), which allows the hard drive and the host controller to manage the data transfers for multiple outstanding commands, without
involving the host processor. NCQ can contribute to better performance but the results are dependent on many factors, including the
access patterns of the various applications and operating system functions that are initiating drive accesses. Enabling NCQ features in
the hard drive requires AHCI support from the host system BIOS, controller, and driver. AHCI support is typically implemented in RAID
configurations.
Note:
 GB = 1 billion bytes. Actual available capacity is less.

System Memory Support
The HP Compaq Pro 6300 Business PC supports the 2nd and 3rd generation Intel® Core™ processor families. Based on a new PC micro-
architecture, the processor is designed for a two-chip platform consisting of a processor and Platform Controller Hub (PCH). Unlike
previous generations, the processor includes an integrated memory controller (IMC). The IMC supports DDR3 protocols with two
independent, 64-bit wide channels each accessing one SODIMM.
Two channels of non-ECC DDR3 unbuffered small outline dual in-line memory modules (SO-DIMM) with a maximum of one
SODIMM per channel
Single-channel and dual-channel memory organization modes
Data burst length of eight for all memory organization modes
DDR3 memory data transfer rates of up to 1600 MHz; actual supported DDR3 data transfer rate determined by the configured
processor.
64-bit wide channels
DDR3 system memory I/O voltage of 1.5V
Theoretical Maximum Memory Bandwidth:
10.6 GB/s in single-channel mode of 21.3 GB/s in dual-channel mode assuming DDR3 1333 MHz
12.8 GB/s in single-channel mode or 25.6 GB/s in dual-channel mode assuming DDR3 1600 MHz
16 GB maximum memory support
CAUTION: 
You must shut down the computer and disconnect the power cord before adding or removing memory modules. Regardless
of the power-on state, voltage is always supplied to the memory modules as long as the computer is plugged in to an active AC outlet.
Adding or removing memory modules while voltage is present may cause irreparable damage to the memory modules or system board.
Memory Configurations:
Slot 1 must always be populated. Not all memory configurations possible are represented below.
NOTE: 
For systems configured with more than 3 GB of memory and a 32-bit operating system, all memory may not be available due to
system resource requirements. Addressing memory above 4 GB requires a 64-bit operating system.

HP USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard
Introduction
:
Boost your security, simplify access procedures and reduce the costs associated with managing networks by preventing unauthorized
access to your computers and networks using smartcard technology with the HP Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard.
The USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard is a full-sized keyboard that takes advantage of digital signatures and certificates to secure the
environment for transactions performed on both public and private networks. The USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard works with all
smart cards that comply with ISO standard 7816.
Smart cards are easy-to-use credit card-sized devices which require multiple forms of information to be validated before you gain
access to your accounts or resources. Used worldwide, smart cards strengthen access to a network or other resource using dual-factor
authentication. Implementing a two-factor authentication (or multi-factor authentication) process reduces the risk of unauthorized
access by verifying and validating your identity in one of the following ways:
Something you know – a combination of username and password or PIN
Something you have – a smart card or security token.
Something you have (smart card) plus something you know (PIN), improves user-access security within corporate network
environments. Smart cards are used in government agencies, healthcare companies and the finance industry.
HP ProtectTools Smart Card Manager provides authentication software for the smart card. The Smart Card Reader module works with
the HP ProtectTools Security Manager and enables the user to setup, use, and manage the smart card. This allows strengthened
security with HP patented technology.
Key Benefits:
Protects against unauthorized access with smart card technology
Delivers even greater security when combined with a HP ProtectTools smart card and the HP
ProtectTools Security Software
Combination of username and password or pin with a smart card or security token
Secures online transactions using digital signatures and certificates
Conforms to industry standards for ease of setup and use
Delivers long product life and quiet operation with high-impact materials and lubricated keys
