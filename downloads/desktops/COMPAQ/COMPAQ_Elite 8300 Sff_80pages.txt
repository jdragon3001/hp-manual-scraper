HP BIOS
 
Key features of the HP BIOS include:
Deployment and manageability – HP BIOS provides several technologies that help integrate the HP Compaq Elite 8300
Business PC into the enterprise, such as PXE, remote configuration, remote control, and F10 Setup support for 12
languages.
Select models feature either Intel Standard Manageability or Intel Core vPro Processor Technology.
Stability – HP BIOS supports the HP stable product roadmap by releasing only critical BIOS changes to the factory and
advanced change notification.
Support UEFI specification 2.1
Computrace agent – For tracking and tracing services, available in select countries, separate software and purchase of a
subscription is required.
Thermal and power management – The HP BIOS provides and enables thermal and power management technologies so
component temperatures are managed for high reliability and to assist in operating the HP Business Desktop computer in
any enterprise environment.
Acoustic performance – Industry leading acoustic emissions across the range of operating conditions.
Serviceability – HP BIOS provides diagnostic and detailed service information.
Upgrades and recovery – HP BIOS provides numerous ways to upgrade HP Business Desktop computers, including BIOS
updates from within DOS (DOSFlash), BIOS updates from within Windows (HPQFlash), HP Client Manager, and fail-safe
recovery. In addition, the HP Business Desktop BIOS Utilities tool enables replicated BIOS setup throughout the Enterprise;
it is available from within the BIOS software and from the support website.
HP BIOS uses PKI signing of the BIOS for trusted BIOS upgrades and recovery.
Additional HP BIOS Features
Power-On password – Helps prevent an unauthorized user from powering on the system.
Administrator password – Also known as the setup password, this helps prevent unauthorized changes to the system
configuration. If the administrator password is not known, the BIOS version cannot be changed and changes cannot be
made to BIOS settings using F10 setup or under the OS.
Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) – Represents a significant innovation in power and configuration
management, allowing operating systems and applications to manage power based on activity and usage. HP Elite models
use ACPI to provide power conservation features.
S5 Max Power Savings setting supports EU Lot6 requirement and allows the computer to power down below 1W is S5 (when
turned off). When S5 Max Power Savings feature is enabled power to slots is turned off along with WOL functionality.

AMD Radeon HD 6350 Graphics Card
Introduction
The AMD Radeon HD 6350 DH PCIe x16 Graphics Card provides a low profile, PCI Express x16 graphics add-in card solution based on the
AMD Radeon™ HD 6350 GPU. This card supports dual display video output through its single DMS-59 connector using a DMS-50
adapter cable.
An ideal solution for desktop PC customers seeking stable 2D and advanced 3D graphics performance, the AMD Radeon HD 6350 DH
PCIe x16 Graphics Card is an excellent choice for small business users engaging in Web conferencing or video or photo editing, while
improving your everyday business PC experience with better graphics and excellent visual display quality.
NOTE: 
Discrete graphics adapters can also access and use shared system memory, aka non-local video memory, through the PCI
Express bus. Because system memory is accessed across the system bus, accessing it is much slower than accessing local memory.
Discrete graphics adapters generally share a portion of system memory with the CPU. Typically, these adapters do not ask for
dedicated use of system memory for graphics, thus leaving more resources available for the rest of the system.

Virtual Desktops (Virtual Desktops allows an end user to create up to 32 individual desktops)
The NVIDIA NVS 300 PCIe Graphics Card is also GPU computing ready. It is capable of enhancing system performance if used in
conjunction with applications that support GPU computing through DirectCompute, CUDA, or OpenCL frameworks.
The NVIDIA NVS 300 PCIe Graphics Card includes 512MB of DDR3 graphics memory. A minimum system memory configuration of 1GB is
needed to support this card.
NOTE: 
Discrete graphics adapters can also access and use shared system memory, aka non-local video memory, through the PCI
Express bus. Because system memory is accessed across the system bus, accessing it is much slower than accessing local memory.
Discrete graphics adapters generally share a portion of system memory with the CPU. Typically, these adapters do not ask for
dedicated use of system memory for graphics, thus leaving more resources available for the rest of the system.

Introduction
:
HP Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) Hard Drives maximize the performance of HP Business PCs by providing the
technologies to meet your increasing storage demands with high-capacity drives offering superior reliability and performance.
SATA provides faster data transfer speeds, better system cooling airflow, more bandwidth, more headroom for speed increases in
future generations and better data integrity. A next-generation technology, the SATA interface connects hard drives to the PC platform
enabling easy aggregation of multiple hard drives into a single PC. This offers you the additional benefits of dedicated bandwidth, the
ability to more easily identify device failures and scalability. The HP Compaq 8300 Pro Business PC supports the latest SATA 6.0Gb/s
specification.
HP Drive Lock
HP Serial ATA Hard Drives offer enhanced security via a new Drive Lock. When enabled, this ATA security feature set prevents software
access to user data on the drive until one or two user-defined passwords are provided.
SMART IV Technology
Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) hard drive technology allows hard drives to monitor their own health and
to raise flags if imminent failures are predicted. If the drive determines that a failure is imminent, the SMART hard drive technology
enables the intelligent manageability or management software to generate a fault alert. While the current versions of SMART hard
drives do a good job monitoring the data on the hard drive media, the ever increasing emphasis on reliability and quality has promoted
HP to implement SMART IV technology which constantly checks that the data flow from host interface to media and media to host
interface is not compromised. This is accomplished by inserting a 2 byte parity code into every 512 byte block in the data path of the
hard drive's Cache RAM. This unique parity checking performed by HP's SMART IV technology hard drives, allows for more complete
error detection coverage encompassing the entire data path between the host and the hard drive.
Smart IV is also known as IOEDC: I/O Error Detection Code.
Native Command Queuing
NCQ or Native Command Queuing is a SATA protocol extension that allows the hard drive to have several write or read commands
outstanding at the same time. In contrast, normal non-queued operation requires each command to be completed before the next
command is issued by the host system. Queuing allows the drive to complete the commands in the order that allows for best overall
throughput. It also involves an advanced method of transferring data to or from the host, called First Party Direct Memory Access
(FPDMA), which allows the hard drive and the host controller to manage the data transfers for multiple outstanding commands, without
involving the host processor. NCQ can contribute to better performance but the results are dependent on many factors, including the
access patterns of the various applications and operating system functions that are initiating drive accesses. Enabling NCQ features in
the hard drive requires AHCI support from the host system BIOS, controller, and driver. AHCI support is typically implemented in RAID
configurations.
Note:
 GB = 1 billion bytes. Actual available capacity is less.

Redundant Array of Independent Drives (RAID)
Flexible implementation:
DriveLock is supported while in RAID mode. Users can manage the DriveLock password from within F10 Setup. Locked drives will
be displayed as such in the RAID option ROM interface.
Hard drive information can be viewed within F10 Setup while in RAID mode. Previously, the hard drives will not appear in Drive
Configuration when switching to RAID mode.
DPS Self Test can be executed on physical hard drives while in RAID mode.
The RAID Setup Utility (accessed through CTRL-I) can be protected by the F10 Setup password.
NOTE:
RAID 1 is the only RAID configuration offered via factory configurations. The pre-configured systems:
Are only available on the SFF and CMT form factors. The USDT does not support RAID as it does not allow for more than one hard
disk drive.
Are complete RAID systems and have both drives installed. If the CMT is configured with three hard disk drives, the third drive is
would be unpartitioned and not part of the RAID array
Have the necessary Option ROM configuration.
Are pre-loaded and pre-installed with all required Intel software.
Include a preinstalled operating system that is mirrored mode out of the box.

System Memory Support
The HP Compaq Elite 8300 Business PC supports the 2nd and 3rd generation Intel® Core™ processor families. Based on a new PC micro-
architecture, the processor is designed for a two-chip platform consisting of a processor and Platform Controller Hub (PCH). Unlike
previous generations, the processor includes an integrated memory controller (IMC). The IMC supports DDR3 protocols with two
independent, 64-bit wide channels each accessing one or two DIMMs.
Two channels of non-ECC DDR3 unbuffered dual in-line memory modules (UDIMM) or DDR3 unbuffered small outline dual in-line
memory modules (SO-DIMM) with a maximum of two DIMMs per channel
Single-channel and dual-channel memory organization modes
Data burst length of eight for all memory organization modes
DDR3 memory data transfer rates of up to 1600 MT/s; actual supported DDR3 data transfer rate determined by the configured
processor.
64-bit wide channels
DDR3 system memory I/O voltage of 1.5V
Theoretical Maximum Memory Bandwidth:
10.6 GB/s in single-channel mode of 21.3 GB/s in dual-channel mode assuming DDR3 1333 MT/s
12.8 GB/s in single-channel mode or 25.6 GB/s in dual-channel mode assuming DDR3 1600 MT/s
32 GB maximum memory support depending upon available number of DIMM sockets
DDR3-1600 (PC3-12800) DIMMs are supported but limited to the 1333 MT/s data transfer rate when not configured with
IvyBridge generation chipset.
CAUTION: 
You must shut down the computer and disconnect the power cord before adding or removing memory modules. Regardless
of the power-on state, voltage is always supplied to the memory modules as long as the computer is plugged in to an active AC outlet.
Adding or removing memory modules while voltage is present may cause irreparable damage to the memory modules or system board.
Memory Configurations: Ultra Slim Desktop
Slot 1 is black and must always be populated. Not all memory configurations possible are represented below.
NOTE: 
For systems configured with more than 3 GB of memory and a 32-bit operating system, all memory may not be available due to
system resource requirements. Addressing memory above 4 GB requires a 64-bit operating system.

HP USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard
Introduction
:
Boost your security, simplify access procedures and reduce the costs associated with managing networks by preventing unauthorized
access to your computers and networks using smartcard technology with the HP Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard.
The USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard is a full-sized keyboard that takes advantage of digital signatures and certificates to secure the
environment for transactions performed on both public and private networks. The USB Smart Card (CCID) Keyboard works with all
smart cards that comply with ISO standard 7816.
Smart cards are easy-to-use credit card-sized devices which require multiple forms of information to be validated before you gain
access to your accounts or resources. Used worldwide, smart cards strengthen access to a network or other resource using dual-factor
authentication. Implementing a two-factor authentication (or multi-factor authentication) process reduces the risk of unauthorized
access by verifying and validating your identity in one of the following ways:
Something you know – a combination of username and password or PIN
Something you have – a smart card or security token.
Something you have (smart card) plus something you know (PIN), improves user-access security within corporate network
environments. Smart cards are used in government agencies, healthcare companies and the finance industry.
HP Client Security Smart Card Manager provides authentication software for the smart card. The Smart Card Reader module works with
the HP Client Security Manager and enables the user to setup, use, and manage the smart card. This allows strengthened security with
HP patented technology.
Key Benefits:
Protects against unauthorized access with smart card technology
Delivers even greater security when combined with a HP Client Security smart card and the HP
Client Security Software
Combination of username and password or pin with a smart card or security token
Secures online transactions using digital signatures and certificates
Conforms to industry standards for ease of setup and use
Delivers long product life and quiet operation with high-impact materials and lubricated keys

Unit Environment and Operating Conditions
General Unit Operating Guidelines
Keep the computer away from excessive moisture, direct moisture and the extremes of heat and cold, to ensure that unit is
operated within the specified operating range.
Leave a 10.2 cm (4 in) clearance on all vented sides of the computer to permit the required airflow.
Never restrict airflow into the computer by blocking any vents or air intakes.
Do not stack computers on top of each other or place computers so near each other that they are subject to each other's re-
circulated or preheated air.
Occasionally clean the air vents on the front, back, and any other vented side of the computer. Lint, dust and other foreign
matter can block the vents and limit the airflow.
If the computer is to be operated within a separate enclosure, intake and exhaust ventilation must be provided on the enclosure,
and the same operating guidelines listed above will still apply.

Additional Features
Description
Towerable Orientation
Product can be oriented as either a desktop or a tower
Drive Lock
Implementation of the industry standard ATA Security feature set. When enabled, it
prevents software access to user data on the drive until one or two user-defined
passwords are provided.
Drive Protection System
DPS Access through F10 Setup during Boot
A diagnostic hard drive self test. It scans critical physical components and every sector of
the hard drive for physical faults and then reports any faults to the user
Running independently of the operating system, it can be accessed through a Windows-
based diagnostics utility or through the computer's setup procedure. It produces an
evaluation on whether the hard drive is the source of the problem and needs to be
replaced
The system expands on the Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology
(SMART), a continuously running systems diagnostic that alerts the user to certain types
of failures
SMART Technology (Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technology)
SMART I - Drive Failure Prediction
SMART II - Off-Line Data Collection
SMART III - Off-Line Read Scanning with
Defect Reallocation
SMART IV - End-to-End CRC for hard drives
Allows hard drives to monitor their own health and to raise flags if imminent failures were
predicted
Predicts failures before they occur. Tracks fault prediction and failure indication
parameters such as re-allocated sector count, spin retry count, calibration retry count
By avoiding actual hard drive failures, SMART hard drives act as "insurance" against
unplanned user downtime and potential data loss from hard drive failure
IOEDC: I/O Error Detection Circuitry
Detects errors in Read/Write buffers on HDD cache RAM
Interface in F10 setup provides confirmation of SMART IV support.
