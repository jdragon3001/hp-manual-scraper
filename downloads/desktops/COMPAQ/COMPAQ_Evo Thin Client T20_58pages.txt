Introduction
Introducing the Compaq Evo Thin 
Client T20 and Compaq T1010 Windows 
Based Terminal
Compaq Evo Thin Client T20 and Compaq T1010 Windows 
Based Terminals are terminals that display windows rather than 
the classic text-based display. They are designed to connect to 
Windows 2000 servers via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), to 
Windows NT servers via ICA (Independent Computing 
Architecture), or to legacy servers using various terminal 
emulations such as TN3270 or TN5250.
RDP is the Windows CE-based presentation service protocol for 
connecting to Windows terminal servers. ICA is the presentation 
service protocol for Windows NT servers. Both allow an 
application’s user interface to execute on a Windows-based 
terminal while the application’s logic executes on the server.
Models Summary
All Compaq Evo Thin Client T20 and Compaq T1010 Windows 
Based Terminals with at least 8 MB of RAM are supported by 
version 3.5 of the terminal software.
✎
Monitors are not provided with Compaq Evo Thin Client T20 and 
Compaq T1010 Windows Based Terminals.
