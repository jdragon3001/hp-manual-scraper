vii 
2.  If the medical panel PC unit does fall to the ground, 
immediately turn the power off and disconnect cords. Then 
contact a service technician for repairs. Continual use of 
the unit may result cause a fire or electric shock. Also, do 
not repair the unit on your own. 
3.  Having two or more people transporting the display unit is 
recommended. In addition, when installing the unit by 
suspending it also requires two or more people. 
4.  Before suspending the unit, make sure the material used 
for suspension is sturdy and stable. If not properly 
suspended, the display unit may fall and cause serious 
injury to people standing nearby as well as to the unit 
itself. 
5.  If you wish to mount the display unit, remember to use 
only the mounting hardware recommended by the 
manufacturer. 
 
Electrical and Power Source Related 
1.  This medical panel PC unit must operate on a power source 
as shown on the specification label. If you are not sure 
what type of power supply used in the area, consult your 
dealer or local power supplier. 
2.  The power cords must not be damaged. Applied pressure, 
added heat, and tugging may damage the power cord. 
3.  The power cord must be routed properly when setup takes 
place. We advise that this aspect measure is to prevent 
people from stepping on the cords or while the unit is 
suspended to prevent flying objects from getting tangled 
with the unit. 
4.  Do not overload the AC outlets or extension cords. 
Electrical shocks or fires may occur from overloading. 
5.  Do not touch the power source during a thunderstorm.

8.  If the unit is not going to be in use for an extended period 
of time, remember to disconnect the unit.  
9.  The medical panel PC unit uses voltage between  
100-240VAC. Connect the unit to a power source with the 
same numerical value as shown. Please use only the power 
cord provided by the dealer to ensure safety and EMC 
compliance. 
 
Various Factors of Environment 
1.  Do not insert objects into the openings. 
2.  Do not have liquids seep into the internal areas of the 
medical panel PC unit. 
3.  Having liquids seep in or inserting objects into the unit 
may result in electric shocks from taking and/or short 
circuiting the internal parts. 
4.  Do not place the medical panel PC unit in the presence of 
high moisture areas. 
5.  Do not install the medical panel PC unit in a wet 
environment. 
6.  Do not place near unit near heat generating sources.

contact with fumes or steam. 
8.  Remember to keep the medical panel PC unit away from 
the presence of dust. 
9.  If water has flow in or seep in, immediately disconnect the 
open frame unit. Then contact a service technician for 
repairs. 
 
Ventilation Spacing  
1.  Do not cover or block the openings on the top and back 
sides of the display unit. Inadequate ventilation may cause 
overheating thus reducing the lifespan of the unit. 
2.  Unless proper ventilation is present, do not place unit in an 
enclosed area; such as a built-in shelf. Keep a minimum 
distance of 10 cm between the display unit and wall.

performance level of the display closely to determine what 
type of servicing is needed. 
2.  Do not attempt to repair the medical panel PC unit on your 
own. Disassembling the cover exposes users’ to high 
voltages and other dangerous conditions. Notify and 
request a qualified service technician for servicing the unit. 
3.  To avoid risk of electric shock, this equipment must only 
be connected to a supply mains with protective earth.

The model CyberMed H22/N22 is intended for use in an electromagnetic 
environment in which radiated RF disturbances are controlled. The 
customer or the user of the model CyberMed H22/N22 can help prevent 
electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum distance 
between portable and mobile RF communications equipment 
(transmitters) and the model CyberMed H22/N22 as recommended 
below, according to the maximum output power of the communications 
equipment.

For transmitters rated at a maximum output power not listed above, the 
recommended separation distanced in meters (m) can be estimated 
using the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter, where P 
is the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) 
according to the transmitter manufacturer.  
NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the separation distance for the higher 
frequency range applies. 
NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. 
Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection 
from structures, objects and people.

  Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones 
and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be 
predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF 
transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in 
the location in which the model CyberMed H22/N22 is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance 
level above, the model CyberMed H22/N22 should be observed to verify normal operation. If 
abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or 
relocating the model CyberMed H22/N22. 
b
  Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than  V/m.

Cleaning/Disinfecting 

Steps: 
1. Wipe the CyberMed H22/N22 with a dry clean cloth. 
2. Prepare agent per manufacturer’s instructions or hospital 
protocol. 

Cautions: 
    Do not immerse or rinse the CyberMed H22/N22 and its 
peripherals. If you accidentally spill liquid on the device, 
disconnect the unit from the power source. Contact your 
Biomed regarding the continued safety of the unit before 
placing it back in operation. 
    Do not spray cleaning agent on the chassis. 
    Do not use disinfectants that contain phenol. 
    Do not autoclave or clean the CyberMed H22/N22 or its 
peripherals with strong aromatic, chlorinated, ketone, ether, 
or Esther solvents, sharp tools or abrasives. Never immerse 
electrical connectors in water or other liquids.

Getting Started 
System Set Up 
The following is a summary of the steps in setting up the system 
for use. 
(1). You can fix the system to a mounting fixture using the screw 
holes on the sides of the system. 
(2). Make any required external connections such as the display, 
keyboard, and LAN. 
(3). Plug the appropriate end of the power cord into the power 
connector on the rear of the system and the plug to an 
electrical outlet. 
(4). 
Waiting for 3 seconds
(5). If necessary, run the BIOS SETUP programs to configure the 
system. 
 then press the power switch on the 
front panel of the system once to turn on the system power. 
 
 
 
Caution:
 
In order to boot up system from USB-CD/DVD drive, 
please connect USB-CD/DVD drive, turn on computer 
power, keep on pressing “F11” key, go into BIOS quick 
boot menu, select “USB-CD ROM”, WAIT FOR 20 
SECONDS, then press enter, system OS will boot up 
from USB-CD/DVD drive directly.

BIOS Setup 
 
BIOS Introduction 
The AMI BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) installed in your 
computer system’s ROM supports Intel processors. The BIOS 
provides critical low-level support for a standard device such as 
disk drives, serial ports and parallel ports. It also adds virus and 
password protection as well as special support for detailed 
fine-tuning of the chipset controlling the entire system. 
 
BIOS Setup 
The AMI BIOS provides a Setup utility program for specifying the 
system configurations and settings. The BIOS ROM of the system 
stores the Setup utility. When you turn on the computer, the AMI 
BIOS is immediately activated. Pressing the <Del> key 
immediately allows you to enter the Setup utility. If you are a 
little bit late pressing the <Del> key, POST (Power On Self Test) 
will continue with its test routines, thus preventing you from 
invoking the Setup. If you still wish to enter Setup, restart the 
system by pressing the ”Reset” button or simultaneously 
pressing the <Ctrl>, <Alt> and <Delete> keys. You can also 
restart by turning the system Off and back On again. The 
following message will appear on the screen: 
 
Press <DEL>  to  Enter  Setup 
 
In general, you press the arrow keys to highlight items, <Enter> 
to select, the <PgUp> and <PgDn> keys to change entries, <F1> 
for help and <Esc> to quit. 
 
When you enter the Setup utility, the Main Menu screen will 
appear on the screen. The Main Menu allows you to select from 
various setup functions and exit choices.
