Power Management 
 
Power management of LCD-PC has the potential to save significant amounts of electricity 
as well as deliver environment benefits. 
 
To be energy efficient, turn off your display or set your LCD-PC to sleep mode after a 
period of user inactivity. 
 
 
Power Management in Windows OS 
 
[Power Options] in Windows OS allow you to control the power management features of 
your display and hard drive. Go to [Start] > [Control Panel]. 
 
 
Then click on the [Power Options] link.

--- Page 15 ---
H24 Series 
Page 9 
 
Select a power plan that suits your personal needs. You may also fine-tune the settings 
by clicking [Change plan settings]. 
 
 
 
The Shut Down LCD-PC Menu presents the options of Sleep (S3) & Shut Down (S5) for 
rapid and easy management of your system power.

--- Page 16 ---
H24 Series 
Page 10 
 
Power Management through ENERGY STAR qualified Monitors (Not 
supply with the LCD PC) 
 
The power management feature allows the LCD-PC to initiate a low-power or “Sleep” 
mode after a period of user inactivity. When used with an external ENERGY STAR 
qualified Monitor, this feature also supports similar power management features of the 
monitor. To take advantage of these potential energy saving, the power management 
feature can be set to behave in the following ways when the system is operating on AC 
power: 
•  Turn off the display after 15 minutes. 
•  Initiate Sleep after 30 minutes. 
 
 
Waking the System Up 
 
The LCD-PC shall be able to wake up from power saving mode in response to a 
command from any of the following: 
•  the power button, 
•  the network (Wake on LAN), 
• the mouse  
• the keyboard 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Energy Saving Tips: 
 
•  Tune the settings in Power Options under Windows OS to optimize your LCD-PC’s 
power management. 
•  Install power saving software to manage your PC’s energy consumption. 
•  Always disconnect the AC power cord or switch the wall socket off if your LCD-PC 
would be left unused for a certain time to achieve zero energy consumption.

System Assembly 
This chapter provides system assembly information and procedures. While performing 
any installation, use a grounded wrist strap before handling computer components and 
carefullyfollow all installation procedures.  Static electricity may damage the 
components. 
 
This chapter will include instructions for how to install CPU, heat sink, memory modules, 
hard disk drive (HDD), optical disk drive (ODD), mini-PCIE card. 
Necessary Tools 
 
 
A Phillips screwdriver can be used to do most of the installation.  One with 
a magnetic head is recommended. Applied maximum torque is 5kg. 
 
 
Pliers can be used as an auxiliary tool to connect some connectors or 
cables. 
 
 
Forceps/tweezers can be used to pick up tiny screws or set up the 
jumpers. 
 
 
Rubber gloves can prevent injury from static charge. 
 
 
 
 
Electric screwdriver can be used to secure all screws more quickly. 
 
 
 
 
    Paper clip to be used to eject the ODD when System is power off.

H24 Series Disassembly 
 
ORIENTATION: Presumes the top of the LCD PC is away from you and the bottom or I/O 
controller board is nearest you.  Do not put any pressure on the LCD PC to avoid adding 
pressure to the System or place any equipment/device on top of it during 
assembly/disassembly. 
 
1.  Place the LCD PCface down on a padded surface. 
 
2.  Remove the four screws from the base plate that attaches the stand to the LCD. 
Supporting the base while removing the last screw. 
 
3.  Open the ODD button rubber and use paper clip to eject the ODD tray. Remove the 
ODD bezel and put it at the side, push the ODD tray back to the unit. 
 
4.  Remove the thirteen back bezel screws. 
 
5.  Carefully remove the back bezel and set aside. 
 
6.  Then remove the metal EMI shield by first removing the I/O cover by removing the 
three screws on the bottom and another three screws on the surface.  Lift the plate 
out and up and set aside. 
 
7.  Remove the remaining twelve screws around the metal shield covering the 
motherboard.

Installing the CPU 
 
NOTE:  If you purchased your LCD PCas a turn-key system, you must first follow the 
instructions to remove the heat sink in order to be able to reach the CPU.  Systems 
purchased as ‘bare bones’ require the installation of the heat sink which is shipped in the 
accessories box with the unit. 
 
 
 
1.  The socket has a plastic cap on it to protect  
thepins from damage.This should remain  
in placeuntil actually installing a CPU. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Raise the plastic cap to reveal the socket 
pins and open the cover by pushing down,  
pulling out and up on the lever beside the  
CPU socket. 
 
Note: Do not touch the socket pins to avoid  
damage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Install the CPU after confirming the direction 
for correct mating. Be sure tohold the CPU  
by theedge of the CPU base. 
Note: The CPU can only be installed in the correct 
direction.  Make sure the CPU pins are completely 
embedded into the socket. If not, take out the CPU 
with vertical motion and reinstall. 
 
4.  Close the cover and the lever to complete  
installation.  Replace the heat sink. 
 
NOTE:  Any violation of the correct installation procedures may cause permanent 
damage to your motherboard.

their positions. 
 
3. Secure the two screws at the opposite end  
near the top edge of the bezel. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Connect the power cable to CPU Fan on the  
Motherboardlabeled CPU FAN 1 connector.
