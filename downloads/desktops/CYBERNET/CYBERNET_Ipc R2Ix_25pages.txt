(Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) 
 
The WEEE directive places an obligation on EU-based manufacturers, distributors, retailers and 
importers to take-back electronics products at the end of their useful life.  A sister Directive, 
ROHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) compliments the WEEE Directive by banning the 
presence of specific hazardous substances in the products at the design phase.  The WEEE 
Directive covers products imported into the EU as of August 13, 2005.  EU-based 
manufacturers, distributors, retailers and importers are obliged to finance the costs of recovery 
from municipal collection points, reuse, and recycling of specified percentages per the WEEE 
requirements. 
 
Instructions for disposal of WEEE by Users in the European Union 
 
The symbol shown below is on the product or on its packaging, which indicates that this 
product must not be disposed of with other waste.  Instead, it is the user’s responsibility to 
dispose of their waste equipment by handing it over to a designated collection point for the 
recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment.  The separate collection and recycling of 
your waste equipment at the time of disposal will help to conserve natural resources and ensure 
that it is recycled in a manner that protects human health and the environment.  For more 
information about where you can drop off your waste equipment for recycling, please contact 
your local city office, your household waste disposal service or where you purchased the

Power Management 
 
Power management of IPC-R2ix has the potential to save significant amounts of electricity as 
well as deliver environment benefits. 
 
To be energy efficient, turn off your display or set your IPC-R2ix to sleep mode after a period of 
user inactivity. 
 
 
Power Management in Windows OS 
 
[Power Options] in Windows OS allow you to control the power management features of your 
display and hard drive. Go to [Start] > [Control Panel]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Then click on the [Power Options] link.

Select a power plan that suits your personal needs. You may also fine-tune the settings by 
clicking [Change plan settings]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Shut Down IPC-R2ix Menu presents the options of Sleep (S3) & Shut Down 
(S5) for rapid and easy management of your system power.

Power Management through ENERGY STAR qualified Monitors (Optional) 
 
The power management feature allows the IPC-R2ix to initiate a low-power or “Sleep” mode 
after a period of user inactivity. When used with an external ENERGY STAR qualified Monitor, 
this feature also supports similar power management features of the monitor. To take advantage 
of these potential energy saving, the power management feature can be set to behave in the 
following ways when the system is operating on AC power: 
  Turn off the display after 15 minutes. 
  Initiate Sleep after 30 minutes. 
 
 
Waking the System Up 
 
The IPC-R2ix shall be able to wake up from power saving mode in response to a command from 
any of the following: 
  the power button, 
  the network (Wake on LAN), 
  the mouse  
  the keyboard 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Energy Saving Tips: 
 
  Tune the settings in Power Options under Windows OS to optimize your IPC-R2ix’s 
power management. 
  Install power saving software to manage your PC’s energy consumption. 
  Always disconnect the AC power cord or switch the wall socket off if your IPC-R2ix 
would be left unused for a certain time to achieve zero energy consumption.

IPC-R2ix BIOS introduction 
This section explains how to use the UEFI SETUP UTILITY to conigure your system. The UEFI 
chip on the motherboard stores the UEFI SETUP UTILITY. You may run the UEFI SETUP 
UTILITY when you start up the computer. Please press <F2> or <Del> during the Power-On-
Self-Test (POST) to enter the UEFI SETUP UTILITY, otherwise, POST will continue with its 
test routines. 
If you wish to enter the UEFI SETUP UTILITY after POST, restart the system by pressing <Ctl> 
+ <Alt> + <Delete>, or by pressing the reset button on the system chassis. You may also restart 
by turning the system off and then back on. 
 
Main Screen 
When you enter the UEFI SETUP UTILITY, the Main screen will appear and display the system 
overview.

Instant Flash 
Instant Flash is a UEFI lash utility embedded in Flash ROM. This convenient UEFI update tool 
allows you to update system UEFI without entering operating systems first like MS-DOS or 
Windows®. Just launch this tool and save the new UEFI file to your USB lash drive, floppy disk 
or hard drive, then you can update your UEFI only in a few clicks without preparing an 
additional floppy diskette or other complicated lash utility. Please be noted that the USB lash 
drive or hard drive must use FAT32/16/12 file system. If you execute Instant Flash utility, the 
utility will show the UEFI files and their respective information. Select the proper UEFI file to 
update your UEFI, and reboot your system after UEFI update process completes.
