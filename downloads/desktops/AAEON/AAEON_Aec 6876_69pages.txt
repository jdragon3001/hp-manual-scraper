Chapter 1 General Information 1-2 
1.1 Introduction 
Due to the growing popularity from the IPC market, the newest 
Boxer series AEC-6876 has been introduced by AAEON.   
 
New Innovation for Entertainment Multimedia Domain 
In this era of i
nformation explosion, the advertising of consumer 
products will not be confined to the family television, but will also 
spread to high-traffic public areas, like department stores, the bus, 
transportation station, the supermarket etc. The advertising 
marketing industry will resort to every conceivable means to 
transmit product information to consumers. System integrators 
will need a multifunction device to satisfy commercial needs for 
such public advertising. 
 
Being a control center, the AEC-6876 is suitable for public 
multimedia entertainment services. Equipped with a high efficiency 
heat conduction mechanism.   
 
The AEC-6876 is compact in size but has attractive and flexible 
extension capabilities such as 4 USB2.0 ports, VGA, Audio, 4 COM 
ports, and PCI-Express slot.   
 
Stable Design for Rugged Environment 
The AEC-6876 is designed for rugged environments due to the 
following reasons; first, it can withstand tough vibration testing up to

--- Page 12 ---
Embedded Controller  AEC-6876 
 
Chapter 1 General Information  1-3 
5 g rms. With the anti-vibration hard drive device option, the 
AEC-6876 can be used in high vibration environments. In addition, 
the AEC-6876 offers low power consumption system that while 
operating in ambient temperatures ranging from -10° to 55°C. 
 
The AEC-6876 is a standalone high performance controller 
designed for long-life operation and with high reliability. It can 
replace traditional methods and become the mainstream 
controller for the multimedia entertainment market.

3.1  System Test and Initialization 
These routines test and initialize board hardware. If the routines 
encounter an error during the tests, you will either hear a few short 
beeps or see an error message on the screen. There are two kinds 
of errors: fatal and non-fatal. The system can usually continue the 
boot up sequence with non-fatal errors. 
System configuration verification   
These routines check the current system configuration against the 
values stored in the CMOS memory. If they do not match, the 
program outputs an error message. You will then need to run the 
BIOS setup program to set the configuration information in memory.   
There are three situations in which you will need to change the 
CMOS settings:   
1.  You are starting your system for the first time   
2.  You have changed the hardware attached to your system   
3.  The CMOS memory has lost power and the configuration 
information has been erased.   
 
The AEC-6876 CMOS memory has an integral lithium battery 
backup for data retention. However, you will need to replace the 
complete unit when it finally runs down.

AMI BIOS ROM has a built-in Setup program that allows users to 
modify the basic system configuration. This type of information is 
stored in battery-backed CMOS RAM so that it retains the Setup 
information when the power is turned off. 
Entering Setup 
Power on the computer and press <Del> or <F2> immediately. This 
will allow you to enter Setup.

Appendix A Programming the Watchdog Timer A-2 
A.1 Programming 
AEC-6876 utilizes ITE IT8728 chipset as its watchdog timer 
controller. 
 
Below are the procedures to complete its configuration and the 
AAEON intial watchdog timer program is also attached based on 
which you can develop customized program to fit your application. 
 
Configuring Sequence Description 
After the hardware reset or power-on reset, the ITE IT8728 enters 
the normal mode with all logical devices disabled except KBC. The 
initial state (enable bit ) of this logical device (KBC) is determined 
by the state of pin 121 (DTR1#) at the falling edge of the system 
reset during power-on reset.

--- Page 40 ---
Embedded Controller  AEC-6876 
 
          Appendix A Programming the Watchdog Timer A-3              
There are three steps to complete the configuration setup: (1) Enter 
the MB PnP Mode; (2) Modify the data of configuration registers; (3) 
Exit the MB PnP Mode. Undesired result may occur if the MB PnP 
Mode is not exited normally. 
 
(1) Enter the MB PnP Mode 
To enter the MB PnP Mode, four special I/O write operations are to 
be performed during Wait for Key state. To ensure the initial state of 
the key-check logic, it is necessary to perform four write operations 
to the Special Address port (2EH). Two different enter keys are 
provided to select configuration ports (2Eh/2Fh) of the next step. 
 
 
(2) Modify the Data of the Registers 
All configuration registers can be accessed after entering the MB 
PnP Mode. Before accessing a selected register, the content of 
Index 07h must be changed to the LDN to which the register 
belongs, except some Global registers. 
 
(3) Exit the MB PnP Mode 
Set bit 1 of the configure control register (Index=02h) to 1 to exit the 
MB PnP Mode.

Configure Control (Index=02h) 
This register is write only. Its values are not sticky; that is to say, a 
hardware reset will automatically clear the bits, and does not 
require the software to clear them.
