Dear customer 
 
We are pleased that you have chosen a system from Fujitsu 
Siemens Computers. We are sure that you will not regret this 
decision.  
 
The analysis of information and feedback provided by our 
customers led us to produce this manual and to keep it constantly 
updated. Our experience shows that general publications about 
PCs designed for users are not always helpful in every case. 
These documents cannot deal in concrete terms with the specifics 
of the PC purchased.  As we know the strengths of our computers 
and any hidden vagaries of the system that might crop up, we are 
in the best position to inform our customers of these problems.  
 
This document was produced with the support of our valued 
customers and the engineers in our company. We hope that the 
assistance it provides will make it easier for you to get to know the 
‘secrets’ of the world of PCs. 
 
The development process for hardware and software in computer 
technology is an ongoing one, and we aim to keep this guide 
constantly updated. However, we cannot provide any guarantee of 
completeness.  
 
In terms of the explanation of installation instructions for system 
settings, there are normally several options. We ask for your 
understanding that we can only present one possible method in our 
explanation of system settings. The illustrations are intended solely 
to support understanding. They do not necessarily match the 
screens on your system exactly in every case. The data for 
devices, drivers and remarks in the illustrations are provided as 
examples.

Safety, precautionary and compliance instructions 
1 
1 Safety, precautionary and compliance instructions 
Your PC complies with the relevant safety regulations for IT 
equipment. Should you have any questions with regard to whether 
you can use the unit where intended please contact your sales agent 
or our service department. 
 
•  Keep this safety information and the other documentation (such 
as the quick guide, operating instructions and CD) with the unit. 
When you pass on the unit to a third party, please also pass on 
all the documentation. 
 
Risk of electrocution 
•  The unit requires a safety-tested power cable which complies 
with the regulations of the country of use. 
•  Check the cables and power plug for signs of damage on a 
regular basis. 
•  The unit may only be connected to an earthed power socket. 
•  You may only operate the unit if its rated voltage matches the 
local mains voltage. 
•  Safe disconnection from the mains supply is only guaranteed by 
removing the power plug from the mains socket. Just because 
the "Power LED" is not illuminated, does not mean that the unit is 
isolated. Simply switching off the PC and add-on devices is not 
enough. 
 
Risk of explosion 
• General warnings: 
Your system is equipped with a replaceable lithium battery. It is 
located on the system board. Once the battery is flat, it can be 
easily exchanged (see system board manual). 
 
Caution! 
There is a risk of explosion if the battery is exchanged incorrectly 
Replace only with a battery of the same type or with an 
equivalent recommended by the manufacturer.

Electromagnetic compatibility 
•  External units, such as monitors, joysticks, etc., may only be 
connected to the interface ports with screened cables to meet the 
harmonised standards under electromagnetic compatibility 
(EMC) legislation. 
•  You may only operate the unit if its rated voltage matches the 
local mains voltage. 
 
Information on R&TTE Directive 
•  Fujitsu Siemens Computers hereby declares that the built-in 
modem conforms to the fundamental requirements and the 
relevant standards contained in the directive 1999/5/EC. 
•  The complete original declaration of conformity for the R&TTE 
Directive can be found in your PC’s electronic documentation. 
 
Computer setup 
•  Before you change, install or remove any components, 
disconnect the mains plug and, if applicable, detach the 
telephone cable from the PC (pull out the plug). 
•  Before you open the housing, you must switch the PC off and 
remove the plug from the socket. The proper operation 
(according to IEC 60950/EN 60950) of the unit is only 
guaranteed with a fully attached housing and covers for 
installation slots ( electrical shock, cooling, fire prevention, noise 
suppression). 
•  Only authorised qualified personnel should open the unit. 
Tampering with the unit will result in a loss of the right to 
guarantee claims and the discontinuation of the manufacturer's 
guarantee obligation to uphold the harmonised standards 
according to the law regarding the electromagnetic compatibility 
of units and low voltage directive. 
•  All integrated circuits and memory modules, as well as the 
contacts on all sockets and plugs, are susceptible to static 
electricity. Protect these from static electricity. The effect of static 
electricity, rapid transients or strong electromagnetic fields on the 
unit may cause faults. When exchanging or installing a board or a 
memory module, touch an earthed object or carry a ground strap 
to divert any electrostatic charge from your body. 
•  All ports are only designed for connection of safety extra-low 
voltage (SELV).

--- Page 12 ---
Safety, precautionary and compliance instructions 
3 
•  The unit can be equipped with a power output which may only be 
used to connect a monitor. 
•  Never open the power supply unit! The components (e. g. power 
supply) marked with a warning (e.g. lightning) may only be 
opened, removed or exchanged by authorised qualified 
personnel. 
•  If the BIOS needs to be updated, only use Fujitsu Siemens 
Computers updates. 
•  When installing additional components (e.g. hard disks) ensure 
that there is adequate cooling. 
 
Repairs 
•  Repairs to the unit may only be carried out by authorised 
qualified personnel. Unauthorised opening and incorrect repairs 
may pose considerable risk to the user (risk of electric shock or 
fire). 
 
Diskettes (applies only to systems with floppy disk drives) 
•  Keep diskettes away from magnets or other magnetic objects 
(monitors also produce a magnetic field). 
•  Damage to the diskette can lead to loss of data. 
•  The LED on the disk drive will light up while the diskette is being 
accessed. The disk drive should not be opened and the diskette 
must not be removed while the LED is illuminated. This could 
damage the diskette and the disk drive. 
 
Optical drives 
•  Use only completely perfect storage media (e.g. CD, DVD) in 
your optical drive to avoid data loss, damage to the machine and 
injury. 
•  Each CD/DVD should be checked for damage such as fine 
cracks, fractures or similar prior to insertion in the drive.  
•  Note that additional adhesive changes the mechanical properties 
of a CD/DVD and may lead to an imbalance. 
•  Damaged and unbalanced CDs/DVDs may break at high drive 
speeds (data loss). Under some circumstances, sharp-edged 
fractures may penetrate the cover of the drive (damage to the 
machine) and be thrown out of the machine (risk of injury, in 
particular to exposed parts of the body such as face and neck).

--- Page 13 ---
Safety, precautionary and compliance instructions 
4 
•  Look after the optical drive and prevent mechanical damage as 
well as premature ware of the storage media by taking the 
following advice:  
−  Only insert CDs/DVDs in the drive when required and 
remove them after use.  
−  Store the CDs/DVDs in appropriate cases. Protect them 
from heat and direct sunlight. 
 
Cleaning 
•  Clean your PC regularly. Before doing so, switch off the PC and 
any peripherals, removing the plug from the socket. Use a non-
abrasive cleaning product and/or a lightly dampened cloth.  
•  Avoid using cleaning sprays and any kind of solution containing 
alcohol or other flammable liquids. Therefore do not use any 
abrasive powder or cleaning agent which dissolves plastic for 
cleaning. 
•  Clean the monitor screen with a soft, lint-free dampened cloth.

Additional notes for proper operation 
•  Position the unit so that there is adequate air for cooling. Never 
cover the ventilation slots on the unit. This could cause 
overheating and thus shorten the life of your unit. 
•  Protect your device from very high humidity, direct sunlight as 
well as high and extremely low temperatures. If the device is 
brought from a cold environment into a warmer installation site, 
bedewing may occur. Wait until the temperature of the device 
has equalised and it is completely dry before you put it into 
operation (approx. 2 to 4 hours). 
•  The unit is not waterproof. Do not immerse it in water and protect 
it from spray (rain, seawater). 
•  Should an abnormal odour or smoke be produced and in 
emergencies (e.g. damage to the housing, operating controls or 
power cable, and liquid or foreign bodies entering the unit), 
switch the device off immediately, remove the plug and contact 
your sales agent or our hotline/Help Desk. 
•  Do not smoke in the vicinity of the unit. Particles of ash may 
settle on the monitor or inside your computer. 
•  Do not eat over the keyboard as crumbs may cause it to 
malfunction. 
•  Ensure that the cables from the PC do not pose any risk (danger 
of stumbling) and cannot be damaged.  
•  The computer should preferably be transported in the original 
packaging as it has been specially designed for the system unit. 
•  Use a high quality double-screened cable to connect the printer. 
If your system comes with a printer cable, you should use it. 
•  The ID plate may also be located underneath the housing. 
•  You may have to remove a securing device used during 
transportation from the underside of the mouse. 
•  When you switch off ATX and µATX systems, the system will still 
be in standby mode and still be connected to the mains. You will 
have to disconnect the mains plug to isolate the unit. 
•  If the monitor is connected to the power socket on the PC power 
supply unit (if available), it will not be turned off when the PC is 
switched off.  
•  If you have a monitor which supports power management, it will 
also switch to standby. If the monitor does not have this function, 
you must switch it off separately when you finish working with the 
PC.

•  The hard disk has already been formatted and the operating 
system has been installed. It will only need to be formatted if the 
drive has to be reconfigured. 
•  The "Product Recovery" CD/DVD supplied can only be used to 
restore/install your operating system if a motherboard with a 
Fujitsu Siemens Computers BIOS is being used. 
•  Consumer PC systems are not suitable for high security and 
medical applications. 
 
Data backup 
•  Create backup copies of your work files on a regular basis. This 
is the only way to protect against data loss, e.g. in the event of a 
hard disk fault. 
•  No liability shall be accepted for loss of data. 
 
Special handling of batteries and rechargeable batteries 
•  The batteries/rechargeable batteries in our units do not contain 
any Cd or Hg compounds.  
•  Your system is equipped with a replaceable lithium battery. It is 
located on the system board. Once the battery is flat, it can be 
easily exchanged. 
Information about the battery regulations of 27.03.1998:

Transporting the system 
12 
3 Transporting the system 
 
If you are going to transport your computer over a long distance, 
for example in a vehicle, you must ensure that the data carriers are 
not at risk of being damaged by the transport. When transporting 
the computer in a vehicle, always make a complete backup of the 
hard disk on an external data carrier. 
If you are transporting the PC only a short distance, i.e. only to 
another room or to a different desk, a backup need not necessarily 
be carried out. However, you must make sure that the unit is 
transported carefully. 
For the onward shipment of the product or other transport, use the 
original packaging or other suitable packaging which provides 
protection against shock and impact. 
Detach all external cable connections and transport all devices 
separately and only in their original packaging or in other suitable 
packaging which guarantees protection against shock and impact.  
Do not drop the device and do not expose it to severe vibrations. 
 
CAUTION!   The computer should ideally be transported in the 
original packaging which has been specifically 
designed for this purpose. 
We only use recyclable material to package our units.

Guidelines and Environmental Protection 
An important characteristic of our products, alongside quality and 
performance, is environmental friendliness. 
(I)  Protection of resources with energy-saving functions 
Our units generally have energy-saving modes. 
 
(II) Device safety 
The units meet the requirements of the low voltage directive 
73/23/EEC including the amendment 93/68/EEC, certified in 
accordance with EN 60950, and the directive on electromagnetic 
compatibility 89/336/EEC including the amendment 93/68/EEC. 
(III)  Guarantee of electromagnetic compatibility 
All data and signal cables must be provided with sufficient 
shielding. The minimum requirement is a Category 5 shielded 
cable for 10/100 Ethernet, or Category 5e for Gigabit Ethernet. As 
described in the operating instructions, all of the housing parts 
must be installed. 
−  Requirements for work with monitors 
Our units meet the requirements set for work with monitors in 
accordance with the EU screen directive 90/270/EEC for the 
purposes of the EU directive 89/391/EEC. 
−  Lasers 
If your system has an optical drive such as a CD-ROM, CD-RW, 
DVD or combined drive, the following applies:  
 
With closed PC housings, the optical drives used correspond to 
laser class 1 in accordance with IEC 60825-1. These contain light-
emitting diodes (LED) which under some circumstances may 
generate a stronger light beam than laser class 1. A direct glance 
into this beam, even with protective eyewear, is dangerous and 
may lead to injury. Therefore, no
 parts of the optical drive housing 
are to be removed.

1 Guidelines 
1.1 EMC directives 
Abbreviation for "ElectroMagnetic Compatibility". As well as the 
effects of electrical smog on human health, the effects of electronic 
devices and installations on other electrical systems are also an 
important aspect of many discussions today. It is not without good 
reason that the standards for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) 
have recently been drastically tightened in the area of computers 
and radio networks. 
 
1.2 CE directives 
CE, the abbreviation for Communauté Europenne, indicates that 
the product conforms with the directives, i.e. it is the 
manufacturer’s confirmation that they have complied with the 
requirements collected in the EU directives, particularly the 
protection requirements for the manufacture of the product.  
 
The CE mark on a product guarantees that the product may be 
brought into circulation within the EU.  
 
Since 1996, CE conformity has been legally binding. All electrical 
and electronic devices must carry the CE mark, as must all data 
networks and their passive components, such as cables, hubs etc.  
From 1
st
 January 1997, companies are no longer allowed to sell a 
product without the CE mark. This has created a legal framework 
where manufacturers have had to introduce technical measures to 
ensure that computer systems meet the required "standards on 
interference emission and resistance to interference". The housing 
is an important aspect of this. Even high-quality structures cannot 
guarantee compliance with the directives. To compensate for 
interference emissions, measures include the use of magnetic 
cores, to comply with the appropriate standards. Unused drive 
slots are sealed with additional slot panels.  
 
1.3 R&TTE directive and FTE law 
The purpose of the law is to control the introduction into circulation 
and the operation of radio equipment and telecommunications 
terminals falling under the jurisdiction of the R&TTE directive, and

--- Page 28 ---
2 
to allow the free movement of these goods within the European 
internal market. 
 
The directive, the RTTE directive 1999/5 EC (Radio equipment and 
Telecommunications Terminal Equipment and the mutual 
recognition of their conformity) has been implemented in German 
law by the FTEG (Funkanlagen und Telekommunikations 
Endeinrichtungs Gesetz – Radio equipment and 
Telecommunications Terminal law).  
 
The directive was published on 7.4.1999 in the EU Official Gazette 
L91/1999 and was thus brought into law.  The FTEG was 
announced in the German Federal Law Gazette Part I, No. 6 on 7 
February 2001, and came into force on 8 February 2001.  
 
1.4 Low voltage directive 
In accordance with the directive 73/23/EEC, appropriate 
regulations have been binding since the seventies. In Germany, 
this directive was brought into legal effect with the Device safety 
law, the first prescription to the law on technical materials. Since 1
st
 
January 1997, manufacturers have not been allowed to see 
products without a CE mark.  
 
The CE mark can be displayed if the product meets the safety 
targets specified in the low voltage directive. In general, this means 
meeting the technical requirements specified in a harmonised 
standard. This directive is applicable for all electrical equipment 
within particular voltage limits.

2 Hardware 
Hardware is a very commonly used term in computer technology. It 
simply refers to all the components of a PC and its peripherals 
(e.g. printers, scanners etc.). 
 
 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... on saving energy
 
•  We recommend connecting the system and the peripherals to 
a standard switchable plug strip. This makes disconnecting the 
entire system from the mains easier, safer and clearer.  
•  PC systems and peripherals that do not have a mains switch 
and are connected to the mains are on "Standby" mode. Power 
consumption is inevitable in this mode. In "Standby" mode the 
system will maintain certain functions, e.g. wake on LAN, wake 
on RING (MODEM). To isolate the system you will either have 
to disconnect the mains plug or switch the system off at a plug 
strip.  
•  If you will not be using the PC for a long period of time, or if 
you will not be using the wake on LAN or wake on RING 
(MODEM) functions, turn off the entire system.  
 
 
2.1 The motherboard 
The motherboard (also called the mainboard) is the most important 
component of your computer. Among other things, it contains the 
CPU, the working memory and slots for additional components. 
You can find important and detailed information in the appropriate 
manual. This is supplied electronically on the 
"Drivers & Utility" CD/DVD or in printed form. 
 
 
2.2 The CPU 
CPU is an abbreviation for the term Central Processing Unit. The 
CPU is the actual "brain" of the computer. It is responsible for all of

--- Page 30 ---
4 
the system’s control and calculation operations. The description of 
a PC system normally specifies the processor type and its speed. 
 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... on the LGA-775 processor socket
 
 
A few systems are using a new Intel CPU. 
The new LGA-775 processor socket is technically configured so 
that the contact between the socket (pins) and the CPU (contact 
points) can be made with adjacent contact pins.  
 
Caution!   Conventional 478pin processors may not
 be used. If 
the current processor is to be changed to a 775pin 
processor, this must be done very carefully, if possible 
by technically qualified personnel. 
 
 
2.3 The working memory 
For the internal exchange of data, the PC requires somewhere to 
temporarily store information. This is done in the working memory, 
also called the main memory. The working memory can be 
accessed very quickly and at any time. However, its content is lost 
when the power is turned off. 
 
 
2.4 Slots 
The slots for expansion cards are located on the motherboard. 
There are the following slots: 
 
for modems 
AMR (Audio Modem Riser)  
CNR (Communication Network Riser) 
 
for graphics cards 
AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) In the near future these slots 
will be replaced by  
PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) Express X16

--- Page 31 ---
5 
 
for other cards, e.g. multimedia, TV card, modem, the 
PCI slots are available. The trend is towards  
PCI Express X1. 
Slots for memory modules to equip the working memory, so-called 
DIMM sockets (abbreviation for "Dual In-Line Memory Modules", 
memory modules with two rows of contacts) are also components 
of the motherboard. The memory banks can be equipped with the 
following memory modules: 
 
•  SD RAM, 168 pin (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access 
Memory). This memory type synchronises itself with the 
system clock, which controls the processor. This prevents 
delays when accessing the memory. It works in 
synchronisation with the external CPU clock.  
•  R-DRAM (Rambus-Dynamic Random Access Memory) also 
known as RIMM (Rambus Inline Memory Module). This 
memory uses a special serial memory organisation, which was 
developed by the company RAMBUS. With this principle, the 
R-DRAM modules must be placed in pairs. Empty RIMM slots 
have to be populated by so-called CRIMMs (Continuity RIMM). 
The CRIMMs prevent an interruption in the signal lines, which 
are a serial connection in a RAMBUS interface, and therefore 
ensure that the direct RAMBUS channel functions correctly. If 
you want to upgrade the system memory at a later date, you 
can remove the CRIMMs and replace them with RIMMs. 
 
When installing RIMMs, you must observe certain rules, in 
order to achieve optimum system performance. 
 
The RIMM slots are divided into two banks: 
•  Bank 0 (RIMM slots 1 and 2) 
•  Bank 1 (RIMM slots 3 and 4) 
 
 
Bank 0 must always be populated first, in order to ensure that 
RIMMS are installed in RIMM slots 1 and 2. The memory 
configuration (speed, number of chips, size and density) of the 
RIMMS installed in Bank 0 and Bank 1 must be identical.
 
•  DDR SDRAM, 184 pin (Double Data Rate Synchronous 
Dynamic Random Access Memory). This memory type uses a 
technology that works with both sides (flanks) of a clock pulse

--- Page 32 ---
6 
to process data. This means that two memory access actions 
are realised per clock pulse, thereby achieving double the 
transmission rate. 
 
With some memory modules, the configuration of the memory 
banks is dependent on the motherboard’s chip set. Information on 
this can be found in the motherboard documentation.
 
 
Detailed information about slots and the BIOS can be found in the 
documentation for the motherboard. 
 
 
2.5 The graphics card 
The graphics card is a hardware component of the computer, 
which allows information to be processed and displayed on a 
monitor. 
 
As digital data is used inside the PC, while traditional tube monitors 
only work with analog signals, the fundamental task of the graphics 
card is to convert the digital information from the PC into analog 
signals for the monitor. 
 
Recently, flat-screen monitors with DVI digital input (Digital Visual 
Interface) have come into use. These devices process the digital 
image signal directly in the monitor. 
 
The essential components of a graphics card are the graphics 
processor, the memory, the RAMDAC (Random Access Memory 
Digital Analog Converter), the internal bus and the interfaces to the 
motherboard, monitor and possibly a TV.  
 
The graphics card is inserted in a specially designed AGP 
(Accelerated Graphics Port) or PCI Express X16 slot on the 
motherboard. The graphics card may also be integrated on the 
motherboard ("graphic on board"). 
 
For low-fatigue work on the PC, it is important from an ergonomic 
point of view that the refresh rate is set correctly. Even at high 
resolutions, this should not be below 85 Hz.

--- Page 33 ---
7 
Modern screen designs use the "Plug and Play" function to set the 
optimum parameters automatically. To do this, they use the DDC 
(Display Data Channel). If the monitor and the graphics card are 
DDC-compatible, they exchange their information via the operating 
system and adjust to one other optimally.  
 
Please follow the instructions in your monitor’s user manual.  
 
Games and graphics applications can take up a great deal of 
memory. It is not only the speed of the CPU that is crucial for 
problem-free running, but also the size of the graphics card 
memory. The capacity of the available graphics memory is crucial 
for the number of colours and their resolution that can be 
displayed, as the colour information for the red, green and blue 
(RGB) colour elements must be provided for each pixel.  Graphics 
cards with a low memory capacity only have a limited range of 
colours. Essentially, the resolution of a graphics card depends on 
the graphics card memory, the refresh rate and the colour depth. 
The higher the resolution and colour depth, the lower the refresh 
rate.  
 
 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... for setting the screen refresh rate (refresh rate)
 
 
Click on "Start" – "Control panel". In this menu click on "Switch 
to standard view". Double click on "Display". Under "Settings", 
click on "Advanced" and then on "Monitor". You can then set the 
"Screen refresh rate". 
 
 
... to change the graphics card 
 
The broadband data bus "PCI Express" will be used with the 
launch of the "Intel
® 
915P" chip set generation located on the 
motherboard, which was developed under the code name 
"Grantsdale". If your system is fitted with a PCI Express graphics 
card, please note that you may only use PCI Express cards. AGP 
graphics cards may not
 be installed as there are no AGP slots 
available.

--- Page 34 ---
8 
... for the memory settings of your graphics card 
 
If the graphics card is on board, a section of the working memory is 
used as a graphics card memory. 
 
If, for applications that use a lot of memory (games etc.), it should 
be necessary to expand the graphic memory, then it is possible to 
change it in the BIOS. The motherboard manual describes how 
you can change the memory capacity. If the process is not 
described, it is not
 possible to adjust the graphic memory. If you 
are still in any doubt, contact the Hotline. 
 
In general 64 MB of graphic memory is the default setting. 
 
Caution!  The memory capacity set for the graphics card is 
subtracted from the main memory capacity of your 
system. 
E.g. 256 MB (main memory) – 64 MB (graphics 
memory) = 192 MB (available main memory)
 
 
 
... for setting the "DirectDraw" function
 
 
Problem: During a PC session you play the same, memory-
intensive 3D game. You have closed the game down properly. The 
second time you run it, "the computer crashes". 
 
You can put this right as follows: 
 
The program "Dxdiag." with the 
icon can be found under 
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32. Double click on the icon and select the 
"Display" tab. The following screen will appear:

--- Page 35 ---
9 
 
 
 
 
Deactivate the "DirectDraw acceleration"
 function. 
 
 
... on connecting and the settings for a second screen output 
device (TV, monitor) 
 
If your PC is equipped with a second screen connection, this is 
generally located on the rear of the PC; it can be that after a driver 
is reinstalled the playback screen of the second output device 
(monitor or TV) may be dark. This may happen if you have 
downloaded and used a new driver version from the Internet. The 
standard default for the driver is only configured for one screen 
output device. 
 
If you wish to use the second output, note the following from the 
user manual of the 2
nd
 device:  
 
•  Which settings and which sockets do I need to use to run the 
device as a monitor for example? 
•  What television standard is for example the TV set to? 
 
If the user manual is no longer available, contact your dealer or a 
television specialist in your area. 
 
Now proceed as follows to use the second output device:  
•  Switch the PC and both screen devices off. Connect the 
screen devices to the PC. Turn the screen devices on, followed

--- Page 36 ---

by your PC, and then make the following settings on your 
computer: 
•  Right click on the desktop and then click on "Properties" 
•  In the "Display properties" window click on "Settings" and 
then on "Advanced". 
•  The settings specific to the graphics cards will appear. One or 
more tabs with the name of the VGA card installed will be 
shown. 
•  Refer to the documentation for the graphics card installed in 
your PC for the advanced settings for two display devices. You 
will find the documentation for your graphics card under: 
"Start"- "All Programs" "Online Documentation" or 
"Manuals". 
 
In the documentation you will find a number of settings which will 
enable you to work easily with two screens. 
 
Note:
  If your TV set model is too old or other settings have 
been made, either no picture will appear or only a black 
and white picture. 
 
2.6 TV cards 
The TV function in the PC is gaining in importance. If your PC is 
already fitted with a TV card or if you would like to fit one in it, we 
would like to inform you of a few basic details at this point. 
 
The TV cards required for TV reception via a PC can be divided 
into two groups – in analog and digital signal-processing modules. 
Both modules are designed on the basis of the MPEG standard, 
but differ in the signal processing. TV cards are also available as 
combined versions.  
 
MPEG is the abbreviation for "Motion Pictures Experts Group". File 
formats and processes for compressing and saving video and 
multimedia data (video, picture and audio data) in high quality were 
and are being established by this organisation.

--- Page 37 ---
11 
Analog TV cards 
 
With analog television, the picture and sound information to be 
transmitted is prepared according to a modulation process and 
forwarded on in wave form in a medium such as air or via a cable. 
This requires an analog TV card with analog antenna input. 
 
Digital TV cards 
 
A digital TV card is required to receive digital programmes via the 
PC. The signal is transmitted according to the standard for the 
compression of TV signals, MPEG-2 (Motion Pictures Experts 
Group, 2
nd
 standard). 
 
The digital technology packs the data as binary code in data 
packets which are then decoded again by the receiver. This 
decoding is carried out by the DVB card in the PC.  
 
There are three options for receiving digital television 
− DVB-C (Digital Video Broadcast-Cable) reception via cable 
− DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcast-Terrestrial) reception via 
antenna 
− DVB-S (Digital Video Broadcast-Satellite) reception via satellite 
 
The reception quality is much better with DVB cards. As the digital 
programmes are transmitted in MPEG-2 format, the TV programme 
can also be processed directly on your PC hard disk. 
 
A further difference is in the decoding of the MPEG stream. 
Differentiation is made between TV cards with hardware MPEG 
and TV cards with software MPEG. 
 
•  With hardware MPEG, the processing power is undertaken by 
a chip on the TV card.  This means that there is practically no 
involvement of the PC’s CPU. The majority of the CPU’s 
processing power remains available for other applications. 
•  With software MPEG, the CPU is responsible for the 
processing power. Under some circumstances this may lead to 
the CPU being noticeably overloaded.

--- Page 38 ---

i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... on DVB-C reception via cable
 
 
Find out from your cable provider which programs you can receive 
digitally. 
 
 
... on DVB-T reception via antenna
 
 
This reception option is one of the most modern signal 
transmission technologies for TV reception and is still not available 
everywhere. Find out from your dealer or via the Internet whether 
you have the option of using DVB-T television. 
 
 
... on retrofitting
 
 
Before considering retrofitting, you must decide how you would like 
to predominantly use your PC.

2.7 The soundcard 
It is no longer possible to imagine many applications without 
sound, e.g. DVD films, TV, games, Internet radio etc. 
 
Soundcards convert digital signals into analog signals that can be 
processed by speakers or amplifiers (DA converter). When 
recording, e.g. with a microphone, analog signals are converted 
into digital signals (AD converter). 
 
The most important components of the soundcard are: Synthesiser 
(sound generator), AD/DA converter (Analog Digital / Digital 
Analog converter) for recording and playing back sounds. 
Connections for headphones or speakers and a microphone are 
integrated. 
 
By default the output signal for sound playback is an analog 
signal at the corresponding connection socket. In some 
configurations, it is also possible to use the sound signal as a 
digital signal. The SPDIF (Sony Philips Digital InterFace) 
connection is available for this purpose. 
 
There are two options for processing and playing back sound on 
our PC systems: 
•  using a soundcard 
•  Sound on Board 
 
 
Sound processing and playback using a soundcard 
 
The soundcard is inserted into one of the PCI slots. In this 
variation, the original manufacturer’s CD is normally supplied. This 
CD contains the necessary drivers, programs and documentation. 
 
Caution!   If it is necessary to restore your system, you should 
install the drivers and programs from the CD 
accompanying the soundcard, as described in the 
"System recovery" manual supplied.

--- Page 40 ---
14 
•  Soundcard and SPDIF 
You will be able to tell if SPDIF is available on the soundcard 
by the cinch socket or the digital optical sound connection 
labelled with SPDIF. If you want to use this signal, you will 
need a speaker system with a decoder that can process digital 
signals. With a digital optical sound connection you will require 
a loudspeaker system with decoder which has digital optical 
input. Make sure you follow the operating instructions for the 
decoder. 
 
•  Using the multi-channel audio function (optional) If you 
want to find out more about the possibilities of multi-channel 
sound, you will find the corresponding information in the 
soundcard documentation. 
 
 
"Sound on Board" sound processing and playback 
 
If your system is equipped with "Sound on Board", then the AC97 
sound standard (Audio Codec 97) or the new Intel
®
 High 
Definition Audio (HDA) sound standard are available to you.  
 
AC97(Audio Codec 97)
 
 
This is processed by a Codec chip (Coder Decoder) which is 
located on the motherboard. The AC97 sound standard is 
implemented by various chip manufacturers using the 
corresponding drivers and the associated programs.  
 
HDA (Intel
®
 High Definition Audio) 
 
The new HDA sound standard, developed under the code name 
"Azalia" will be introduced with the new 
"Intel
® 
915P" chip 
generation. This new audio standard will soon supersede the AC97 
standard. It offers considerably improved recording and 
reproduction properties. The automatic assignment recognition of 
the audio sockets is new. When you assign an audio socket, the 
menu for the "Realtek" player automatically appears with the 
associated "Audio Wizard".

--- Page 41 ---
15 
With this audio standard, the majority of the processing work is 
assigned to the main processor. It is responsible for synthesiser 
functions and mixes the digital data. The audio data is then 
converted and sent to a Codec. This then converts the data into 
audio signals.  
 
In the recording direction, the Codec digitises the data and the 
processor is then responsible for converting the data into 
appropriate file formats and sampling rates. In the analog section, 
Codecs are also responsible for the mixing of other inputs and 
outputs such as those for the PC speakers, the microphone or the 
CD player. 
 
 
•  "Sound on Board" and SPDIF. 
If sound is "on board", consult the motherboard description to 
find out whether a connection for SPDIF is available on the 
board. If you want to use this signal, you will need a speaker 
system with a decoder that can process digital signals. Make 
sure you follow the operating instructions for the decoder. 
 
•  Using the multi-channel audio function (optional) 
If your motherboard is equipped with an appropriate Codec 
chip, you can use the multi-channel audio function. In general, 
the drivers for the Codec chip are linked to a program, which 
allows you to make the appropriate settings. If this function is 
available, you will find the corresponding manufacturer’s 
information in the motherboard documentation.

Select" or "Alternative microphone" and close the open 
window.  
 
This setting activates the microphone connection on the rear of the 
PC. (if necessary test as above) 
 
 
2.8 Modem and ISDN card 
MODEM
 
 
Modem is an abbreviation for "MODulator/DEModulator". The 
modem is a remote data transmission device, which 
•  establishes a connection to a remote station, 
•  converts (modulates) signals coming from the computer into 
sounds, 
•  sends these to the remote station, 
•  and, used on the other end of the line, reconverts 
(demodulates) the sounds received into machine-recognisable 
signals.  
 
There are countless standards – protocols – for modems to ensure 
that they can communicate with one another. These standards are 
defined by the CCITT (Comité Consultatif International 
Télégraphique et Téléphonique). 
The most recent analog modem standard V.92 was confirmed by 
the ITU (International Telecommunication Union). Downstream 
communication is unchanged at 56 kbit/s. The three most 
important improvements compared to the V.90 standard that is 
widely used today are: 
 
•  Upload at up to 48 kbit/s possible (only 33 kbit/s with V.90) 
•  Faster connection setup 
• Supports the "modem on hold" function. This means that 
when you receive a telephone call while online, you will be 
notified. The modem function will be "parked" and you will be 
able to return to your Internet function once you have 
completed your phone conversation. 
If you want to use this standard and your modem is compatible 
with this standard, then find out from your provider whether they 
support V.92.

 Our tips and hints …  
 
... for setting the country code 
 
 
When dialling country and area codes, WindowsXP uses the 
settings that are entered under "Telephony" in the Control Panel.  
 
After installation of Windows a country, e.g. "United Kingdom", may 
already be entered under Location/Country. This may lead to 
wrong numbers being dialled when using the modem. Before using 
your modem for the first time, you should therefore change this 
setting to the country in which you are running the PC and by 
entering the appropriate number under "Area code". 
 
For example, for the United Kingdom, the procedure is as follows: 
• Open "Start" / "Control Panel" / "Printers and other 
hardware" / "Telephone and modem options". 
•  Select the "Dialling rules" tab, by double clicking on "New 
location" under Location. "Edit location" appears. 
• Under "Country/Region" select "United Kingdom" and enter 
your local area code under "Area code", then click on "Apply" 
and confirm with "OK". 
 
 
ISDN 
 
ISDN is the abbreviation for Integrated Services Digital Network.  
ISDN cards are used to establish a data connection between any 
two compatible terminals. In contrast to a modem, these terminals 
(ISDN cards) work on an exclusively digital basis (no 
modulation/demodulation). Data transmission takes place on two 
channels, each at 64kbit/s. These channels are known as B 
channels. A further channel known as the D channel is responsible 
for the exchange of control signals for the transmission terminals.

2.9 Wireless LAN (WLAN) 
WLAN stands for Wireless Local Area Network, i.e. a cable-free 
network. The IEEE standard 802.11(Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers) for wireless LANs (WLANs) offers two 
configuration methods for wireless networks, the ad-hoc mode and 
the infrastructure mode. 
 
Ad-hoc mode (peer-to-peer work group) 
 
 
 
In an ad-hoc network, individual computers are connected to each 
other as required. In other words, there is no fixed structure or 
fixed points in the network. As a rule, any node may communicate 
with any other node. In this configuration there is no AccessPoint. 
This enables a small WLAN work group may be quickly 
established. The individual members of the group can exchange 
data with each other and share printers, as permitted by the 
Microsoft network functions of the various Windows operating 
systems. A few providers also refer to an ad-hoc network as a 
peer-to-peer network. In this configuration, data packets are 
transmitted directly from a transmitting to the corresponding 
receiving station. Insofar as the individual stations are located 
within its respective range, this is the most simple and least costly 
method of establishing a WLAN.

--- Page 48 ---
22 
Infrastructure mode (AccessPoint) 
 
 
 
With a wireless AccessPoint your can operate a WLAN in the 
infrastructure mode. You may then connect a wireless connection 
to several wireless devices within a specified area or the range of 
the AccessPoint. Communication with the wireless nodes is via an 
antenna. In infrastructure mode, the wireless AccessPoint converts 
the data transmitted in the form of radio waves into Ethernet data 
and thereby forms the bridge between the individual wireless 
clients and the wired LAN. By connecting several AccessPoints via 
an Ethernet backbone, the range of a wireless network can be 
expanded. If a mobile device falls outside the range of an 
AccessPoint, it falls within the range of another. This means that 
wireless clients can be moved freely from the domain of one 
AccessPoint to the next, thereby maintaining a wireless connection 
to the network.

 Our tips and hints … 
 
... on establishing WLANs
 
 
Checking the hardware and drivers 
 
Switch your WLAN adapter on. The operating instructions for your 
device will tell you where to activate the WLAN function. 
 
Proceed as follows: 
Click on "Start" > "Control Panel" > "Performance and 
Maintenance" > "System" > "Hardware" > "Device manager". 
Double click on Network adapter. 
 
 
 
Caution!   The name of the WLAN adapter may differ from 
device to device.  
 
Should a yellow exclamation mark or a red cross appear against 
the listed WLAN adapter, there is a resource conflict or an incorrect 
configuration.

--- Page 50 ---
24 
When you double click on the WLAN adapter, you will see its 
properties such as manufacturer, driver version and date as well as 
resource settings. 
 
... for configuring a WLAN connection
 
 
1.  Click on "Start" > "Connect with" > "Wireless network 
connection". The following window will appear. 
 
 
 
Should there be another WLAN device in range, this will be 
displayed in the list of "available wireless networks" as 
shown here in the example. The displayed name 
"CONNECT2AIR" represents the device’s SSID. This may be 
anything. 
 
2.  To connect with this network, activate the function: "Facilitate 
connection with wireless network even when the network 
is not secure" and click on "Connect". The connection will 
then be established to the existing network. 
 
Should the list be empty, then no WLAN device was found in 
the vicinity or the other device was configured as "hidden".  
 
3.  Click on "Advanced…". The following appears:

--- Page 51 ---
25 
 
 
4.  Activate the function "Use Windows to configure the 
settings". Click on "Add“. The following appears:

--- Page 52 ---
26 
5.  Enter the SSID in the "Network name (SSID)" field of the 
device to which the connection is to be established. The 
network names (SSID) can be obtained from the operator of 
the receiver. 
 
If the connection requires data encoding, activate the function 
"Data encoding" and enter the required key in the "Network 
key" field. 
 
6.  Click on "OK". 
 
To connect two WLAN devices with each other in ad-hoc mode, 
execute the specified steps for both devices and enter the same 
SSID in this window. Activate the function "This is a computer-to-
computer network; wireless access points are not used". Click 
on "OK". 
 
This display will appear in the task bar next to the clock after 
successful connection: 
 
 
 
The signal strength displayed may vary due to external influences. 
 
If you double click on the active connection (both screens in the 
task bar), a window containing status information will appear. This 
may differ depending on the network setup.

This completes the establishment of the WLAN connection. 
 
 
2.10 Drives 
Device, which can write and read storage media such as diskettes 
or hard disks, in order to save data permanently, i.e. even after the 
power is turned off. 
 
2.10.1 Floppy disk drive (optional) 
Your computer is optionally equipped with a floppy disk drive.  
 
A diskette is a thin, flexible plastic disc, which is coated with a 
magnetic substance. This is then placed in a more or less stable 
housing. Diskettes are also called "floppies" or "floppy disks".  
They can be used to: 
 
•  Transfer information from one computer to another and to 
•  Create backup copies of the files and software on the hard 
disk. 
 
Standard floppy disk drives can read and write to 3.5” diskettes, 
which can store up to 1.44 MB of data.

The table below shows which formats can be processed: 
   Comment 
DD 720 KB  
HD 1.44 MB  
ED  2.88 MB  Motherboard dependent and special 
floppy drive required 
 
To work with a 3½" disk, insert it into the drive with the label facing 
upwards and the read/write slot first. To remove the disk, press the 
eject button; the disk can then be removed. 
 
 
 
Eject button 
3½" drive 
 
Caution!   The LED on the disk drive will light up while the 
diskette is being accessed. The disk drive should not 
be opened and the diskette must not be removed 
while the LED is illuminated. This could damage the 
diskette and the disk drive.

--- Page 55 ---
29 
2.10.2 Hard disk 
The hard disk is a rigid disc, which is coated with a magnetic 
substance and protected by a metal housing (hard disk drive). A 
hard disk drive essentially consists of several discs, a spindle 
motor, read/write heads and a device for positioning the head. The 
hard disk is located inside your computer, but it can be exchanged. 
 
Hard disks work in accordance with ATA (Advanced Technology 
Attachment). This describes the protocol in accordance with which 
the data is transported via the cables. ATA is a drive specification 
for hard disk connections defined by ANSI (American National 
Standard Institute). 
 
There are two types in our PCs: 
 
•  For hard disks, the widely used IDE (Integrated Drive 
Electronics) connection standard (40-pin) is used on the 
motherboard. The IDE connection is also called PATA (Parallel 
ATA). This standard PC interface is primarily used for optical 
drives and hard disks.  
•  Another connection option for hard disks is the use of the 
SATA (Serial ATA) interface (4-ping), if this is available on the 
motherboard.  
 
The hard disk is your computer’s main storage medium and you 
can make your work easier and more productive by copying your 
applications and files onto your hard disk. You can copy files to the 
hard disk or delete them from it as often as you want. 
 
The hard disk drive should be handled with great care, as it is very 
sensitive.

3 Jumper 
The CD-ROM drive is configured via jumpers. These determine 
how the device will be addressed by the IDE controller. If the 
jumper is set to Master, the device works in Master mode, to 
Slave in Slave mode. If the jumper is set to CSEL, the device 
can be controlled with the help of the CSEL interface signal 
(Cable SELect).

CD/DVD data carriers 
 
The CDs/DVDs available in the market correspond to different 
standards. Not every CD/DVD can be read by every optical drive.  
 
CD-ROM 
Abbreviation for “Compact Disk - Read Only Memory”. A CD 
ROM is a CD storage medium, on which up to 700 Mbytes of 
digitised data is stored. However, this data cannot be changed 
and can only be read by an optical drive. In principle, CD-ROMs 
are read in the same way as audio CDs but cannot be used in 
audio equipment. 
 
CD-R 
Abbreviation for "Compact Disk Recordable". A CD-R can only 
be written once. Once a CD-R has been finalised, it is no longer 
possible to delete or edit the content of the CD-R. 
 
CD-RW 
Abbreviation for "Compact Disk ReWritable". A CD format that 
allows you to write to a CD any number of times using a CD-
RW drive. You can then read the information as often as you 
wish. The CD-RW can be compared to a floppy disk, as it can 
be used for the repeated storage of data. 
 
Not all older optical drives can read CD-RWs. 
 
DVD 
Abbreviation for "Digital Versatile Disk" or "Digital Video Disk". 
A DVD is a storage medium, similar to a CD, but with a higher 
memory capacity, which is achieved by narrower tracking. A 
DVD can be used in two positions, and on both sides 
(depending on the type), which means that the memory 
capacity can be 25 times that of a CD.  
 
Because of the high memory capacity, DVD is particularly well 
suited for digitised films with additional features such as 
different languages or subtitles.  
 
For DVD films, so-called regional codes were introduced in 
1997, which are intended to prevent e.g. US DVDs from being

--- Page 60 ---
34 
able to be played on European equipment and vice versa. For 
this purpose, the world was divided into six regions:  
 
1.  USA, Canada  
2.  Japan, Europe, Middle East, South Africa 
3. South-east Asia 
4.  Australia, South and Central America, New Zealand  
5.  Africa, former USSR, India 
6. China 
 
DVD drives resemble CD-ROM drives and are downwards 
compatible, which means that they can also read CD-ROMs, 
CD-RWs and audio CDs.  
 
 
DVD+RW drive 
Like CD-RW drives, DVD+RW drives can both read and write 
storage media. Rewritable (RW) DVD+RWs are used. At 4.7 
GBytes, DVD+RWs offer a memory capacity equivalent to 
around seven times that of a normal CD-ROM. 
 
For the user, these drives make it possible to transfer and 
archive their own VHS videos, record their own videos using a 
digital video camera or save data quantities that are too large 
for CD-ROMs.  
 
 
DVD 
± R/RW drive 
These drives enable you to use both recording processes 
(DVD+R/RW, DVD-R/RW). 
 
 
 
DVD+R9 or DVD+R DL drive (d
ouble layer) 
(Digital Versatile Disc + Recordable 9 Gigabytes) 
 
These drives are equipped with the new double-layer DVD 
recording technology. 
The writing of a second layer onto the 
DVD blank doubles the maximum data capacity from the 4.7 
GB of conventional 
DVDs to 8.5 GB on a one-sided DVD.

 Our tips and hints … 
 
... on playing DVDs with WinDVD Player
 
 
With some DVD films, you may find that the picture freezes. A 
possible solution to this problem is that you need to disable 
"Accelerated hardware decoding". 
 
To do this, use the following setting: 
 
•  Right click while WinDVD Player is open. 
•  In the subsequent menu, click on "Setup" and then on "Video". 
• Deactivate: 
"Use accelerated hardware decoding" (remove check mark). 
•  Click on "Apply" and then on "OK". This completes the 
process. 
 
 
... for activating/deactivating properties of optical drives (e.g. 
AutoPlay function) 
 
If it is necessary to modify the autostart (AutoPlay) function of 
DVD/CD-ROM drives, you can do this as follows: 
•  Right click on "Start" and select "Explorer". 
•  Right click on the drive whose autostart function you want to 
edit. 
•  Left click on "Properties". 
•  In the menu that then appears, select the "AutoPlay" tab.  You 
can then set an action according to the content (content type) 
of the CD-ROM/DVD. 
 
Caution!  Note that you must select the actions individually 
for each "Content type" and confirm with 
"Apply". 
 
 
... for the use of regional codes
 
 
If your system is equipped with a DVD drive, please note that the 
regional code can only be changed a maximum of five times
. After

--- Page 62 ---
36 
the fifth time, the code is retained as a permanent code; you 
should therefore be careful about changing it. If you set the same 
regional code as in the last installation, this is not registered as a 
change. This process is determined on the hardware side and 
cannot be cancelled using software. 
 
Before buying a DVD video, you should check that the regional 
code on the DVD video matches the code set on your PC. 
 
 
... for using the correct blank DVDs
 
 
There is not a general standard for burning (writing) DVDs 
currently. The most common recording methods for DVD burners 
are: DVD+RW, DVD-RW and DVD-RAM. Although the 
technologies are similar, each of these formats requires specific 
blank DVDs and is based on a separate recording technology.  
 
With most burning programs, you can find out under "Properties" or 
"Infotool" which blanks can be used.  
 
We recommend that on systems with Fujitsu Siemens Computers 
DVD burners, the following blank DVDs be used: 
 
DVD+RW rewritable blank DVDs or  
DVD+R non-rewritable DVDs.

--- Page 63 ---

3 Software 
3.1 General Information 
Software is a chain of logic operations that tells the hardware, 
which operations are to be executed. These logic operations are 
known as programs. These programs consist of commands and 
instruction sequences. These are processed electronically in bits 
and bytes. 
 
A bit is the smallest unit of electronic information. As it is very 
complicated to handle individual bits, 8 bits are combined in a byte. 
The byte is the basic unit of measurement in the computer world. 
 
 
i
 Our tips and hints …  
 
... for data backup
 
 
•  Create backup copies of your work files on a regular basis. 
This is the only way to protect against data loss, e.g. in the 
event of a hard disk fault. 
•  No liability shall be accepted for loss of data. 
 
 
... for installing programs
 
 
Before installing new programs, close all applications. 
 
After installing programs, you should always restart your computer, 
even if you are not prompted to do so. 
 
 
... for installing programs with and without the Autostart 
function 
 
The fact that the Autostart function is not active can be due to 
Properties having been automatically edited when installing 
programs, e.g. a burning program or DVD player. If the Autostart 
function is activated, system errors may occur under certain

--- Page 64 ---
38 
circumstances when blank CDs are inserted. Leave the Autostart 
function for the CD-RW drive (burner) deactivated. 
 
... for driver installation when restoring your system
 
 
If you should need to re-install your system, we urgently 
recommend that, as far as possible, you backup all files before 
complete reinstallation. 
 
If you have carried out your complete reinstallation using the 
"Product Recovery CD ROM" and the "Drivers & Utility CD/DVD", 
as described in the general user manual, and one of the 
components of your system is still not working, you can put this 
right, provided that it is a driver problem and there is no 
mechanical damage. 
To do this, proceed as follows: 
 
•  Insert the "Drivers & Utility" CD/DVD in the appropriate drive. 
After the CD/DVD auto-starts, the "Fujitsu Siemens Help 
Center" appears. Close this with "Exit". 
•  With the "Drivers & Utility" CD/DVD inserted, click on "Start". 
•  Right click on "Desktop". 
•  Click on "Properties". "System properties" appears.  
•  By clicking on "Hardware" you can open up the "Device 
manager". 
•  The "Device manager" shows an overview of your computer’s 
hardware. This is where you can update the drivers (or the 
software) for hardware devices or change the hardware 
settings.  
•  The faulty driver is normally indicated by a yellow question 
mark (?). 
•  Right click on this line. 
• Select "Update driver" in the menu that appears. 
•  Continue with "Install software automatically 
(recommended)" and confirm with "Next". 
•  If necessary, follow the instructions on the screen.

--- Page 65 ---
39 
... for automatically opening files of the same format 
 
Right click on a file icon (e.g. with the file extension .jpg). Select 
"Open with" and click on "Select program". The following screen 
will appear: 
 
Here, you can assign a file type to a 
program which you want to use to 
open files of that type. If you want 
this file type to always be opened 
using the selected program, use the 
mouse to enter a check mark in 
"Always use this program to open 
these files". 
 
 
 
 
 
If the following screen appears when you open a file, select the 
option "Select program from list" and confirm with "OK". 
 
 
 
The first screen shown then appears. You may then proceed as 
described above. 
Caution!  Only file types supported by the selected program 
may be opened. Consult the appropriate program 
documentation for details of the file formats 
supported. 
 
If you still cannot open the document, you must install a program 
that can process that file format.

3.2 The operating system 
The operating system is the "organiser" of your computer; the 
operating system coordinates all functions e.g. for the graphics 
card, the soundcard, the modem the network card and the external 
devices using drivers. 
 
If your operating system should fail to start, or if faults should occur 
on your hard drive, it may be necessary to reinstall the pre-installed 
software. 
 
Computers from our company are supplied with a pre-installed 
"Microsoft® Windows® XP Home Edition" operating system as 
standard. 
 
On your PC, you can find the registration code label as proof of the 
legitimate purchase of the "Windows XP" operating system. This 
registration code is not necessary for any reinstallation variation of 
the operating system, as it is a BIOS-locked OEM version. You 
should therefore only use BIOS versions that have been certified 
by Fujitsu Siemens Computers. 
 
With the BIOS-locked OEM version, which you have purchased 
with your Fujitsu Siemens computer, it is not necessary to activate 
the "Windows XP" operating system. Registration is optional. For 
details, see the manual "Microsoft® Windows® XP Home 
Edition - Getting Started".  
 
In case of a problem, you can restore the system to its status on an 
earlier date, without losing personal data files (e.g. documents, 
Internet favourites and e-mail).   Windows XP system recovery 
monitors changes to the computer and generates easily identifiable 
recovery checkpoints on a regular basis. These recovery 
checkpoints allow you to restore the system to its status at an 
earlier point in time.

--- Page 67 ---
41 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... for creating a restore checkpoint 
 
 
•  Click on "Start"/"Control Panel"/"Performance and 
Maintenance" and then on "System recovery". 
•  Select the option "Create recovery checkpoint" and then click 
on "Next". 
•  In the field "Description of recovery checkpoint", enter a 
name to identify this recovery checkpoint. The system recovery 
automatically adds the date and time when the checkpoint was 
created to this name.  
•  Click on "Create" to complete this process. 
 
 
... for  restoring the system to a previous status
 
 
•  Click on "Start"/"Control Panel"/"Performance and 
Maintenance" and then on "System recovery". 
•  Select the option "Restore computer to a previous point in 
time". Confirm with "Next". The checkpoint can be selected in 
the subsequent screen. 
•  If you have any questions or require further help, you should 
use the comprehensive "Help and Support Center", by 
clicking on the question mark in the top right of the screen. 
•  You can also create and name your own recovery checkpoints 
at any time.

3.3 BIOS 
BIOS is the abbreviation for "Basic Input Output System". The 
BIOS is the hardware-specific core of an operating system, which 
is not deleted when the system is turned off and is located in the 
EPROM. Data is written to this chip once, can only be read by the 
computer, and can only be changed at a later date using special 
programs (Flash-BIOS). Each time the computer is turned on, the 
BIOS first of all runs a self-test. The computer then uses the BIOS 
to start the operating system and to control the stream of data 
between the hard disk, graphics card, keyboard and printer, until 
the operating system takes over this task. 
 
 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... for using the BIOS
 
 
The BIOS is tailored to the specific demands of the system by the 
manufacturer. Therefore, only the BIOS approved and certified by 
the manufacturer should be used. 
 
Current BIOS updates can be found at: www.fujitsu-siemens.com
 
 
... accessing the BIOS
 
 
In its delivery state, the BIOS is optimised such that a very short 
boot time is achieved. To access the BIOS setup, immediately after 
switching on the machine, i.e. during the boot process, press the 
key to call the BIOS several times at short intervals until the BIOS 
main menu appears on your screen. 
 
Note:  Further information on setup and which key you must 
press (e.g. F2 or Del) can be found in the motherboard 
documentation.

3.4 Drivers 
Drivers are programs, which allow interaction between the 
computer, operating system and other components. It is therefore 
important to install the correct component drivers for the correct 
operating system. 
 
The drivers we have tested are coordinated with the component 
manufacturer and tailored for the system supplied and are normally 
found on the "Drivers & Utility" CD/DVD or on an enclosed Drivers 
CD-ROM/diskette.

3.5 INTERNET  
The Internet is the world’s largest computer network, and consists 
of many individual networks linked to one another. The features or 
"services" of the Internet include electronic mail (e-mail) and file 
transfer (FTP). 
 
When using Internet services, it is important to use antiviral 
software and to update it regularly. 
 
 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... for establishing a connection to the Internet
 
 
You can establish an Internet connection with the help of a 
CD/DVD provided by an Internet service provider or without the 
help of a CD/DVD. 
 
If you are establishing an Internet connection through a provider, 
insert the provider’s CD/DVD into the CD/DVD drive and follow the 
on-screen instructions. 
 
To establish an Internet connection without a CD/DVD, you must 
obtain the dial-up number of the provider which you wish to use, 
the user name and the password. Then proceed as follows: 
 
•  If no previous Internet connection has been set up on your PC, 
click on: "Start"; "Control Panel", "Network and Internet

... for using antiviral software 
 
Fujitsu Siemens Computers systems are always supplied with pre-
installed antiviral software. If you have completely set up the 
antiviral software and you decide to purchase another piece of 
antiviral software, you must always uninstall the fully installed 
antiviral software properly first. Otherwise, installation of a second 
piece of antiviral software without previously uninstalling the 
existing software may be successful but could lead to severe 
software conflicts.

4 Peripherals 
Peripherals are external components of the computer, i.e. devices 
connected to the PC such as monitor, keyboard, printer, etc.. 
 
4.1 Keyboard 
4.1.1 Keyboard areas and important keys 
The keyboard is the "actual" interface between the user and the 
computer. It is used to input commands. It is similar in design to a 
typewriter, but has a few more keys. 
 
Adjusting the keyboard
 
 
The keyboard may be positioned flat or gently inclined to suit 
individual needs. If you look underneath the keyboard you will find 
two feet which can be pulled out to adjust the keyboard. 
 
Wrist support
 
 
If your keyboard has a wrist support, please fix it to the keyboard. 
Depending on the keyboard type, this may be done in one of two 
ways: 
 
With the curved design place the wrist support in front of the 
keyboard and push in the direction of the arrow until it slots into 
place.

--- Page 74 ---
48 
With the straight design place the wrist support on a flat surface 
and press the keyboard down from above with the notches on the 
underside of the keyboard lined up with the pins on the wrist 
support until it slots into place. 
 
 
 
The wrist support is intended for breaks during typing. You should 
not therefore rest the balls of your thumbs on the wrist support 
while typing. 
 
Connecting the keyboard
 
 
Connect the keyboard before turning on the PC. Keyboards may 
have different plugs with which they are to be connected to the PC. 
 
PS/2: Insert the round, purple plug of the keyboard cable into the 
purple PS/2 port on your computer. 
 
USB: Insert the square, black connector of the keyboard cable into 
a free USB port on your computer. 
 
Keyboards with cables do not require any batteries, even if there is 
a battery compartment on the underside. 
 
Key groups
 
 
The standard Windows keyboard consists of the following sections: 
 
- Main keyboard 
- Numeric keypad 
- Cursor keypad 
-  Function keys and 
- Windows-specific keys

--- Page 75 ---
49 
Main keyboard 
 
The layout of the main keyboard essentially corresponds to that of 
a typewriter keyboard. Pressing a key generates the corresponding 
character and moves the cursor forward by one position. Most keys 
have a repeat function, i.e. if you hold down the key, the entry of 
that character is repeated. However, there are a few country-
specific keys (so-called dead keys) which do not cause the cursor 
to move forwards when pressed. 
 
A few PC-specific keys on the main keyboard are assigned special 
functions: 
 
The RETURN, ENTER key  <         > 
This key is used to have the current command input executed by 
the computer. After inputting a text line, pressing this key moves 
the cursor to the beginning of a new line. Depending on the 
program in use, the function of the <RETURN> key on the main 
keyboard and <Enter> on the numeric keypad may be different. 
 
The BACKSPACE key  <> 
This key moves the cursor one space to the left and deletes the 
last character. 
 
The SPACE BAR <     > 
Pressing this key moves the cursor one space to the right and 
inserts an empty space at the same time. Please note that an 
empty space is treated in the same way as a letter or number. 
 
The TAB key <               > 
In word-processing programs, this key is used to move the cursor 
to the next tab stop. Depending on the program in use, the key 
may also be used for other cursor movements or functions. 
 
The SHIFT key <> 
Two identical shift keys are located on the left and right sides of the 
main keyboard. Pressing the shift key while simultaneously 
pressing a letter or number generates the letter in upper case or 
the relevant special character. In connection with the numeric

--- Page 76 ---
50 
keypad, it is possible to toggle between cursor movement and the 
input of numbers. 
 
The CAPS LOCK key <>  
This key is used to enter upper case letters. If this key is engaged, 
the central LED ("Caps Lock" / "<>" / "A") is illuminated on the 
keyboard. Pressing the CAPS LOCK key again reverses the lock 
(depending on the operating system). 
 
The <Alt> key 
The function of this key is program-dependent. It is always used in 
connection with other keys. Like the SHIFT key, when pressed 
alone it generally has no function. In the operating system as well 
as in many programs, special characters which cannot be found on 
the keyboard can be entered with the aid of the ALT key and 
commands can be generated. 
 
The <Alt Gr> key 
This key is used to enter the special characters shown on some 
keys as a third option. E.g. if you wish to enter the "\" character, 
hold down <Alt Gr> while also pressing the <ß> key. 
 
The <Ctrl> key 
This key is a control key. Like the ALT key it is only active in 
combination with other keys. Its meaning varies from program to 
program. 
 
The <Esc> key 
This is program-dependent. When working in the operating system, 
the current prompt entered in the command buffer will be deleted. 
 
Windows-specific keys:
 
These keys only exist on a Windows keyboard as they support 
Windows-specific functions. The keys are: 
1 stkey: between <Ctrl> and <ALT>, left side 
2ndkey: between <Alt Gr> and <Ctrl>, right side next to <Alt Gr> 
3rdkey: next to 2nd key

WIN key  Function  Description 
1 st& 2nd key  <Ctrl> + <Esc>  Windows Manual Appendix 
Key combinations 
3rdkey  <Shift> + <F10> Windows Manual Appendix 
Key combination 
 
You can also work with this keyboard if you do not have Windows 
installed. If this is the case, these keys have no function. 
 
 
The numeric keypad
 
 
 
 
Number keys 
The keys in this block have two purposes. Firstly, they represent 
the numbers 0 to 9 and the comma, secondly the cursor control 
functions. They can be switched from one function to the other 
with the <Num Lock > key. Pressing it once switches from the 
cursor control function to the numbers, pressing it again returns to 
cursor control. The setting in use is indicated by the LED located at 
the top left ("Num" / "Num Lock" / "1"). 
Numbers:  The LED at the top left is illuminated. 
Cursor control:  The LED at the top left is not illuminated.

--- Page 78 ---
52 
The <Ins> key 
The <Ins> key is the Insert key. In the operating system mode, 
characters on the screen can be replaced by being overwritten with 
a new character. The <Ins> key can be switched to the insert 
mode, and the newly entered characters are inserted at the cursor 
position. 
 
Please note that the use of this key may be program-dependent. 
 
The <Del> key 
The <Del> key is used to delete the character at which or before 
which the cursor stands. 
 
Programs may assign this key other functions. 
 
Cursor keys
 
 
 
 
The keys in the cursor keypad and the correspondingly designated 
keys of the numeric keypad have the same use. It is also possible 
for programs to assign other uses to these keys. 
 
<>  moves the cursor one line up 
<>  moves the cursor one line down 
<>  moves the cursor one character to 
the right

--- Page 79 ---
53 
<>  moves the cursor one character to 
the left 
<Home>  moves the cursor to the beginning 
of the line or to the top left corner 
of the screen 
<End>  moves the cursor to the end of the 
line or to the bottom right corner of 
the screen 
<Page Down>  moves the display one screen 
page down 
<Page Up>  moves the display one screen 
page up 
 
Function keys
 
The general function keys, labelled <F1> to <F12>, each have a 
different use depending on the program being used. Their use in 
the operating system is detailed in the associated manual. 
 
The <Print Screen> key 
 
Pressing <Print Screen> produces a copy of the content of the 
screen. 
 
The <Scroll Lock> / 
 key  
The <Scroll lock > key is used to change the function of the 
cursor keys. This is program-dependent. If the "Scroll Lock" mode 
is activated, the LED ("Scroll Lock" / 
 ) at the top right is 
illuminated. 
 
The <Pause/Break> key 
Used by the operating system and a few applications.

--- Page 80 ---
54 
Functions accessed by pressing several keys simultaneously 
The following key combinations are used in the WINDOWS 
operating system control panel; their function is to some extent 
program-dependent: 
<Ctrl> + <Alt> + <Del> System reboot 
Pressing the three keys simultaneously 
aborts the current program and reboots 
the operating system.  
Caution: Data which has not been 
saved to the main memory will 
be lost. 
<Ctrl> + <Pause> Program halt 
Simultaneously pressing Ctrl and Pause 
aborts the current program. 
<Ctrl> + <Home>  This key combination moves the cursor 
to the beginning of a document. 
<Ctrl> + <End>  This key combination moves the cursor 
to the end of a document.

4.1.3 Wireless keyboard 
If your PC comes with a wireless keyboard, usually in combination 
with a wireless mouse, please refer to the special instructions in 
the accompanying manual. 
 
Using the keyboard
 
The keyboard is configured for ergonomic and healthy working. 
Awkward configuration of the input and output devices, incorrect 
arm or seat posture and uninterrupted use of the keyboard or 
mouse may lead to tension, tiredness and injury to the musculo-
skeletal system (nerves, muscles, tendons and joints). This risks 
can be considerably reduced if you follow the advice below. 
 
•  Arrange your workstation in accordance with the 
recommendations for an ergonomic workstation in the PC’s 
operating instructions. 
•  Position the keyboard such that it can be operated without 
noticeable burden. The keyboard should be arranged in 
parallel to your upper body. This position facilitates a relaxed 
shoulder and arm position.
 
•  The distance between the keyboard and edge of the desk 
should be between 5 and 10 cm. 
•  While typing, hold your hands and 
lower arms such that they form 
the most natural line possible. Do 
not bend your hands too much to 
the side.
 
 
•  Keep your wrists straight while 
typing. Do not bend your hands up 
or down. Adjust the tilt of the 
keyboard to meet your individual 
needs using the fold-out support on 
its base.
 
 
 
•  While typing do not support your hands on the balls of your 
thumbs and do not hit the keys too hard. 
•  Relax your hands and wrists by taking regular breaks. During 
these typing breaks you should support your hands on the 
balls of your thumbs or rest your lower arms on the armrests. If 
necessary, perform appropriate loosening exercises.

4.2 Mouse 
The mouse is an input device which is guided by hand over a flat 
and horizontal surface. The recording of the movement takes place 
mechanically or optically. The mouse movement is analysed by the 
computer and the cursor is moved accordingly across the screen. 
At appropriate positions, the mouse buttons can be used to 
activate actions such as inputs, opening and closing files or charts. 
 
The two-button wheel mouse can be used as a two-button mouse 
in all operating systems. Under Windows operating systems, you 
can use the wheel by turning it to navigate within the application 
window and as a third button by pressing it. 
 
The symmetrically designed mice are equally suitable for right-
handed and left-handed users. 
 
Mice may have different plugs with which they are to be connected 
to the PC. 
 
PS/2: Insert the round, green plug into the green socket on the PC 
before switching it on. 
 
USB: Insert the square, black connector of the mouse cable into a 
free USB port on your computer or a connected USB hub. 
 
USB-PS/ adapter: Some mice have a green USB-PS/2 adapter. 
Without this adapter, the mouse can be used in a USB socket, with 
the adapter in the PS/2 interface. This adapter can only be used for 
the mouse with which it was delivered.

 Our tips and hints …  
 
... ...for the function of the wheel mouse
 
 
If you require further information about the functions of the wheel 
mouse and want to access the menus for assigning functions and 
changing the settings, the procedure is as follows: 
 
•  Click on "Start" and select "Control panel". 
•  Click on the icon or name "Mouse" to open the "Mouse 
properties" dialog box. 
 
Here, you can adjust the mouse properties individually to match 
your working methods. 
 
 
... on using an optical mouse
 
 
The scanning system of an optical mouse works on many surfaces. 
However, please note that heavily reflective or red surfaces may 
cause faults. 
 
 
... on using a mechanical mouse
 
 
Make sure that you use a mechanical mouse on a clean, flat 
surface. The use of a mouse pad is recommended. 
 
Clean the ball and the mechanical scanning system regularly. 
Carefully remove the ball cover and take out the ball. This will also 
provide access to the axes of the mechanical system for cleaning. 
Carefully refit the parts in reverse order.

4.3 Monitor 
A monitor is, of course, part of the PC. It is the visual medium of 
communication between the user and the machine. 
 
It is important that you follow the instructions relating to 
ergonomics, which should be contained in the instruction manual 
for the monitor. These include: Correct posture, correct distance 
between the eyes and the monitor (approx. 50 cm), positioning of 
the keyboard within optimum reach of the hands.   
 
4.4 Printers 
Printers are output devices, which can output electronic data in 
paper form as a so-called print medium. 
 
In order for the printer to receive the desired data from the PC, it 
must be connected to the computer’s printer port. This port 
normally has the designation LPT1. However, it is also possible to 
communicate with modern printers via the USB port.  
 
The printer setup program is a component of Windows. If you want 
to connect a new printer to your computer, you must inform your 
PC of this. The printer setup program helps you to install the driver 
and informs Windows which new printer you have connected and 
how the operating system selects it. 
 
4.5 Scanners 
Similar to a copier, a scanner makes a kind of electronic 
photograph of a document. The scanner converts this "photograph" 
to a file, which can be understood by a computer. A photograph is 
thus turned into a digital image, which you can save as a file and 
process using appropriate graphics programs.

5 Expansion of performance 
5.1 Upgrading the system 
Your system is of a modular configuration. This means that in 
general you have the option of upgrading your system with various 
components and modules (e.g. working memory, hard disk, 
graphics card, etc.) obtainable from your specialist dealer or a 
computer shop. 
 
 
i
 Our tips and hints … 
 
... on component expansion
 
 
Before expanding your system, find out from the motherboard 
description which components are compatible with your system.  
 
For example, take note of: 
•  the working memory type 
•  the hard disk type to be used (SATA or IDE) 
 
 
... adequate cooling 
 
 
When upgrading your PC ensure that the components have 
sufficient cooling. If your are unsure, contact a local computer 
expert. 
 
Caution!  Heat build-up in your system may lead to irreversible 
damage and a risk of fire due to overheating of 
system components.

5.2 Opening and closing the housing 
CAUTION!  Only qualified personnel should open the PC. 
Tampering with the unit will result in a loss of the 
right to guarantee claims and the discontinuation of 
the manufacturer’s guarantee obligation. 
Compliance with the harmonised standards 
according to the legislation regarding 
electromagnetic compatibility of units and 
compliance with the low voltage directive may be 
interfered with. 
•  When opening the PC it must be ensured that you 
do not use any force and that no locking 
mechanisms are damaged. 
•  All integrated circuits and memory modules are 
susceptible to static electricity. When exchanging 
or installing a board or memory module, we 
recommend touching an earthed object (e.g. 
housing), to divert any electrostatic charge from 
your body. 
 
To open the housing, proceed as follows: 
 
1.  Turn off the PC and all connected peripherals (monitor, printer 
etc.). 
2.  Disconnect the mains plug directly
 before opening the housing

6 Troubleshooting (FAQ) 
There are two general types of error message: 
•  Software error messages 
• System error messages 
 
6.1 Software error messages 
Software error messages are displayed on the screen by the 
operating system or an application. These messages generally 
appear after you have started the operating system or when you 
run an application. If this type of error message appears, refer to 
the manual for the respective application or the operating system 
to find out how to resolve this error. 
 
6.2 System error messages 
A system error message indicates a computer problem.  
 
The following checklist describes how you can eliminate small 
problems yourself. In the event of serious defects, you may have to 
contact your dealer or the customer hotline. Please refer to the 
relevant sections of the service documents supplied.  
 
The computer will not start (boot)  
•  Your computer may not be connected to the power socket. 
Switch the computer off, check all the connections and then 
switch the computer on again.  
•  Your mains socket may be faulty. Check whether there is 
power to the mains power socket by plugging in another handy 
electrical device which you know is functioning correctly. 
•   Check whether the mains switch on the back of the computer 
is switched on (position "1"). It is possible that by moving the 
computer, a cable or similar may accidentally switch the mains 
switch to "0". 
•  If your computer is equipped with a floppy disk drive, check 
whether the startup process is being interrupted by a non-
bootable disk in the disk drive. If this is the case, you must 
remove the diskette.

--- Page 95 ---
69 
•  The worst-case scenario is that the operating system has been 
damaged, e.g. by a virus. If this is the case, execute a 
"complete reinstallation of the operating system". 
•  If you correctly follow the instructions under "Complete 
reinstallation of the operating system" and reinstallation is still 
not possible, there could be a defect in one of the system 
components such as the power supply unit or on the hard disk. 
If you do not have the necessary technical expertise, repairs of 
this magnitude should be carried out solely by a service 
engineer.
