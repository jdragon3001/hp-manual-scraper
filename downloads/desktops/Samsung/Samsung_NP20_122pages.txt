FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q1: How can I troubleshoot wireless LAN connection issues on my Samsung NP20?
A1: If you're experiencing issues connecting your Samsung NP20 to a wireless LAN, first ensure that the network name and encryption key are correctly configured. Check that the device driver is properly installed—an exclamation mark near the network adapter in Device Manager indicates a problem with the driver. Additionally, ensure that the TCP/IP properties are properly configured.

Q2: What should I do if my Samsung NP20's modem is not working properly?
A2: To troubleshoot modem issues, first restart your system and reinstall the modem driver if necessary. If there's no response in the Diagnostics tab of the Modem Properties window, the modem may not be functioning correctly. Ensure that you exit all programs using the modem before running diagnostics.

Q3: My screen resolution is incorrect when playing certain games. How can I fix this?
A3: If the screen is not displaying correctly when playing games like NHL Hockey 2003 and is limited to 1024x768 resolution, you should adjust the Windows screen resolution settings to match the maximum supported by the game.

Q4: How can I properly install and remove the battery on the Samsung NP20?
