BIOS SETUP
Enter BIOS Setup
The BIOS is the communication bridge between hardware and software, correctly setting up the BIOS pa-
rameters is critical to maintain optimal system performance. Power on the computer, when the message 
“Press <Del> to enter setup. Press <F7> to enter boot menu.” 
appears at the bottom of the screen, you can press <Del> key to enter Setup.
Use the arrow right/left keys to select a specic function and go to the submenu. Each function is ex-
plained below:
Main   
  It displays the basic system conguration, such as CPU Name, memory size, system date, time and  
  so on. They all can be viewed or set up through this menu.
F-Center
  The advanced system features can be set up through this menu.
Advanced
  The advanced system features can be set up through this menu.
Boot
  Boot features can be set up through this menu. You can set the boot device priority and enable “Quiet  
  Boot” feature here.
Power
     All the items related with Green function features can be setup through this menu.
Health
    This setup enables you to read/change fan speeds, and displays temperatures and voltages of your CPU/System.
Security
  The Administrator/User password can be set up through this menu to prevent unauthorized use of  
  your computer. If you set a password, the system will ask you to key in correct password before boot  
  or access to Setup.
Save&Exit
  The optimal performance settings can be loaded through this menu. However, it may offer better   
  performance in some ways (such as less I/O cards, less memory ...etc.),  still, it may cause problem  
We do not suggest that you change the default values in the BIOS Setup, and we shall 
not be responsible for any damage which resulted from the change you made.

  if you have more memory or I/O cards installed. It means, if your system loading is heavy, set to    
  optimal default may sometimes come out an unstable system. What you need now is to adjust BIOS  
  setting one by one, trial and error, to nd out the best setting for your current system. You also can

[AHCI] - The Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) specication describes the register level 
interface for a Host Controller for Serial ATA. The specication includes a description of the hardware/
software interface between system software and the host controller hardware. AHCI provides more 
advanced features including SATA features, but some SATA drives may not support AHCI, unless they 
are labeled with AHCI support in its specication. If your motherboard supporting AHCI, and you have 
a SATA device, which also supports AHCI, then you can select IDE option to have fair performance 
(only PATA, SATA level), or you can select AHCI to get its best performance.
      [RAID] - When you enable RAID, it means all your SATA drives must also support AHCI.

BIOS SETUP
Power
                 
ACPI (Advanced Conguration and Power Interface) is an open industry standard interfaces enabling 
OS-directed conguration, power management, and thermal management of mobile, desktop, and 
server platforms. It denes ve sleeping states, they are :
S1 - The S1 sleeping state is a low wake latency sleeping state. In this state, no system context is lost 
(CPU or chip set) and hardware maintains all system context. (also called Power On Suspend)
S2 - The S2 sleeping state is a low wake latency sleeping state. This state is similar to the S1 sleeping 
state except that the CPU and system cache context is lost (the OS is responsible for maintaining the 
caches and CPU context). Control starts from the processor’s reset vector after the wake event.
S3 - The S3 sleeping state is a low wake latency sleeping state where all system context is lost except 
system memory. CPU, cache, and chip set context are lost in this state. Hardware maintains memory 
context and restores some CPU and L2 conguration context. Control starts from the processor’s 
reset vector after the wake event. (also called Suspend to RAM)
S4 - The S4 sleeping state is the lowest power, longest wake latency sleeping state supported by ACPI.

BIOS SETUP
In order to reduce power to a minimum, it is assumed that the hardware platform has powered off all 
devices. Platform context is maintained. (also called Suspend to Disk)
S5 - The S5 state is similar to the S4 state except that the OS does not save any context. The system 
is in the “soft” off state and requires a complete boot when it wakes. Software uses a different state 
value to distinguish between the S5 state and the S4 state to allow for initial boot operations within the 
BIOS to distinguish whether or not the boot is going to wake from a saved memory image. 
► ACPI Sleep State 
This item is used to set the energy saving mode of the ACPI function. When you select “S1 (POS)” 
mode, the power is always on and computer can be resumed at any time. When you select “S3 
(STR)” mode, the power will be down after a period of time. The status of the computer before it 
entering STR will be saved in memory, and the computer can quickly return to previous state when 
the STR function wakes.
► Resume By USB Device(s) 
This item is used to enable or disable the USB device(s)  to generate a wake up.
► Resume By Onboard LAN 
This item is used to enable or disable the onboard LAN to generate a wake up.
► Resume By RTC 
This item is used to enable or disable RTC alarm event to generate a wake up. 
RTC is system real time clock.
► RTC Alarm Date(Days) 
When Resume by RTC is enabled, select a specic date to generate a wake up.
► RTC Alarm Time(HH:MM:SS) 
When Resume by RTC is enabled, select a specic time to generate a wake up.
► Energy-using product
  This item is used to congure the DeepSx Mode conguration.
