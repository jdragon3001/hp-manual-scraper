BIOS SETUP
Enter BIOS Setup
The BIOS is the communication bridge between hardware and software, correctly setting up the BIOS pa-
rameters is critical to maintain optimal system performance. Power on the computer, when the message 
“Press <Del> to enter setup. Press <F7> to enter boot menu.” 
appears at the bottom of the screen, you can press <Del> key to enter Setup.
Use the arrow right/left keys to select a specic function and go to the submenu. Each function is ex-
plained below:
Main   
  It displays the basic system conguration, such as CPU Name, memory size, system date, time and  
  so on. They all can be viewed or set up through this menu.
F-Center
  The advanced system features can be set up through this menu.
Advanced
  The advanced system features can be set up through this menu.
Boot
  Boot features can be set up through this menu. You can set the boot device priority and enable “Quiet  
  Boot” feature here.
Power
     All the items related with Green function features can be setup through this menu.
Health
    This setup enables you to read/change fan speeds, and displays temperatures and voltages of your CPU/System.
Security
  The Administrator/User password can be set up through this menu to prevent unauthorized use of  
  your computer. If you set a password, the system will ask you to key in correct password before boot  
  or access to Setup.
Save&Exit
  The optimal performance settings can be loaded through this menu. However, it may offer better   
  performance in some ways (such as less I/O cards, less memory ...etc.),  still, it may cause problem  
We do not suggest that you change the default values in the BIOS Setup, and we shall 
not be responsible for any damage which resulted from the change you made.

BIOS SETUP
  if you have more memory or I/O cards installed. It means, if your system loading is heavy, set to    
  optimal default may sometimes come out an unstable system. What you need now is to adjust BIOS  
  setting one by one, trial and error, to nd out the best setting for your current system. You also can  
  save or discard the changes and exit BIOS setup here.
