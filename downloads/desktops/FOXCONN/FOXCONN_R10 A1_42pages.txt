Installation Precautions
   Please carefully read the following procedures to install your computer :
■  It is suggested to select high-quality, certied fans in order to avoid damage 
to the motherboard and CPU due to high temperature. Never turn on the 
computer if the CPU fan is not properly installed.
■  We cannot guarantee that your system can operate normally when your 
CPU/Memory is overclocked. Normal operation depends on the overclocking 
capacity of your device.
■  If there is any, when connecting USB, audio, 1394a, RS232 COM, IrDA or 
S/PDIF cables to the internal connectors on the motherboard, make sure 
their pinouts are matching with the connectors on the motherboard. Incorrect 
connections might damage the motherboard.
■  When handling the motherboard, avoid touching any metal leads or  connec-
tors.
■  If there is a PCI Express x16 graphics card installed in your system, we 
recommend using a 24-pin ATX power supply to get the best performance.
■  Before turning on the power,  please  make  sure  the  power  supply AC input 
voltage setting has been congured to the local standard.
■  To prevent damage to the motherboard, do not allow screws to come in contact 
with the motherboard circuit or its components. Also, make sure there are no 
leftover screws or metal components placed on the motherboard or within the 
computer casing. 
■  If you are uncertain about any installation steps or have a problem related to 
the use of the product, please consult a certied computer technician.

■  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the sudden and momentary electric current 
that ows between two objects at different electrical potentials. Normally it 
comes out as a spark which will quickly damage your electronic equipment. 
Please wear an electrostatic discharge (ESD) wrist strap when handling 
components such as a motherboard, CPU or memory. 
■  Ensure that the DC power supply is turned off before installing or removing 
CPU, memory, expansion cards or other peripherals. It is recommended to 
unplug the AC power cord from the power supply outlet. Failure to unplug 
the power supply cord may result in serious damage to your system.

2-4 Jumpers
For some features needed, users can change the jumper settings on this motherboard to modify them. 
This section explains how to use the various functions of this motherboard by changing the jumper 
settings. Users should read the following content carefully prior to modifying any jumper setting.
Description of Jumpers
1. For any jumper on this motherboard, Pin 1 can be identied by the bold silkscreen next to it. 
However, in this manual, Pin 1 is simply labeled as “1”.
2. The following table explains different types of the jumper settings. "Closed" means placing a jumper 
cap on the two pins to temporarily short them. The shorting can also be done by touching two 
pins by a screwdriver for a few seconds, but using jumper cap is recommended. It can prevent 
hazardous ESD (Electrical Static Discharge) problem.
 
Clear CMOS Jumper: CLR_CMOS
The motherboard uses CMOS RAM to store the basic hardware information (such as BIOS data, 
date, time information, hardware password...etc.). Clear CMOS data is the fast way to go back to 
factory default when the BIOS settings were mistakenly modied.
The steps to clear CMOS data are : 
1. Turn off the computer, unplug the power cord from the power outlet.
2. Remove jumper cap from pins 2-3, put it onto pins 1-2 to short them. This will clear CMOS 
data.
3. Return the setting to its original with pins 2-3 closed.
4. Plug in the power cord to your computer and turn it on.
5. Go to BIOS Setup to congure new system as described in next chapter.

Enter BIOS Setup
The BIOS is the communication bridge between hardware and software, correctly setting up the 
BIOS parameters is critical to maintain optimal system performance. Power on the computer, 
when the message "Press <DEL> to enter Setup, <F7> to Boot Menu" appears at the bottom of 
the screen, you can press <DEL> key to enter Setup.
Use the arrow right/left keys to select a specic function and go to the submenu. Each function is 
explained below:
Main   
It displays the basic system conguration, such as CPU Name, memory size, system date, 
time and so on. They all can be viewed or set up through this menu.
Advanced
The advanced system features can be set up through this menu.
Chipset   
The values for the chipset can be changed through this menu, and the system performance 
can be optimized.
Boot
Boot features can be set up through this menu. You can set the boot device priority and enable 
"Quiet Boot" feature here.
Power
All the items related with Green function features can be setup through this menu.
Health
This setup enables you to read/change fan speeds, and displays temperatures and voltages of 
your CPU/System.
Security
The Administrator/User password can be set up through this menu to prevent unauthorized 
use of your computer. If you set a password, the system will ask you to key in correct pass-
word before boot or access to Setup.
Save&Exit
The optimal performance settings can be loaded through this menu. However, it may offer bet-
ter performance in some ways (such as less I/O cards, less memory ...etc.),  still, it may cause 
problem if you have more memory or I/O cards installed. It means, if your system loading is 
heavy, set to optimal default may sometimes come out an unstable system. What you need 
now is to adjust BIOS setting one by one, trial and error, to nd out the best setting for your 
current system. You also can save or discard the changes and exit BIOS setup here.
We do not suggest that you change the default values in the BIOS Setup, and we shall
not be responsible for any damage which resulted from the change you made.
