WARNING 
   You will be asked whether the MiniPC should search for additional    
  devices in the selected network and whether it should automatically    
  connect to these devices (for example, printers or television sets).  
  This is recommended in private home networks that you can trust. If    
  you connect to a public wireless network, we recommend that you  
  decline this option by clicking "nO". In this way, you protect your private sphere.
You can now surf the Internet as usual using the Internet browser.
Connecting to a network/the Internet via a cable (LAN)

end with your router. 
No additional steps on the MiniPC are required for a connection with the network.
i
  Depending on the configuration of your router, the IP address is assigned 
automatically or the IP address has to be issued manually. Read the operating 
instructions for your router for more information.
After you have successfully connected to your local network, network sharing 
allows you to transfer files between the MiniPC and other devices in the network 
or play files from the MiniPC.
i
  If you would like to connect to the Internet via the network, make sure that the 
router can access the Internet. Read the operating instructions for your router for 
more information.
11) Downloading applications from the Windows Store
The Windows Store is available as a live tile on the start screen. You can identify 
the Windows Store by its icon, a shopping bag featuring the Windows logo.
The following two requirements must be met in order to access the Windows 
Store:
1. You must be connected to the Internet.
To connect, follow the instructions in Section 10.
2. You must have a Microsoft account and be signed in with it.
Ideally, you will have created a Microsoft account or signed in with your existing 
Microsoft account during the initial setup process when you first switched on 
your MiniPC. In this case, all you have to do is open the Windows Store, select the 
desired app and click "
install".

(cf. "COnneCting tO a netwOrk/the internet via Cable (lan)") and use network sharing to 
transfer files between the MiniPC and other devices in the network or to play back 
files from the MiniPC.
Transferring files between the MiniPC and a tablet or mobile phone
To transfer files between the MiniPC and a tablet or mobile phone, it is generally 
sufficient if you connect the tablet or mobile phone to the USB A-socket of the 
MiniPC with a commercial USB cable (note the connection possibilities of the 
tablet or mobile phone!). The MiniPC automatically recognises the connected 
device and you will find it listed in the drive overview ("this pC").
i
   If you connect a Windows tablet to the MiniPC, it will not be recognised as a drive.  
To transfer files between the MiniPC and a Windows tablet, proceed as described in 
the "transferring files between the miniPC and anOther PC" section of these instructions.
13)  Automatic Windows Update function
Your MiniPC checks for new updates daily (an Internet connection must be 
available). If you selected the "express settings" option in the Start Assistant when 
you switched on for the first time, the MiniPC automatically performs available 
updates when you shutdown (download and installation).  
Therefore, to keep your MiniPC always up to date, you merely have to activate 
the Internet connection regularly.
Proceed as follows if you wish to subsequently activate or deactivate the 
automatic update function:
