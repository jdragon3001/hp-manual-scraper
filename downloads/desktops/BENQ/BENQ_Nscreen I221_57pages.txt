Using BIOS setup 25
Using BIOS setup
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a layer of software, called 
firmware, that translates instructions from other layers of 
software into instructions that the nScreen hardware can 
understand. The BIOS settings are needed by the nScreen to 
identify the types of installed devices and establish special 
features.
When and how to use BIOS 
setup
You need to use BIOS setup when:
• You see an error message on the screen requesting you to run 
BIOS setup.
• You want to restore the factory default settings.
• You want to modify some specific settings according to the 
hardware.
• You want to modify some specific settings to optimize system 
performance.
BIOS settings are specific to your nScreen hardware. Do NOT 
change existing BIOS settings unless you are sure they need 
to be changed, and are aware of the consequences. Any 
incorrect BIOS settings may degrade the performance, 
operation and functionality of your nScreen.
For latest BIOS updates, visit http://www.benq.com/support/.
• The BIOS setup screen shown in this chapter is for your 
reference only. The actual items or settings on your nScreen 
may differ.
• The BIOS setup program may have been updated after the 
publication of this manual.
• The settings you select in your operating system might 
override similar settings in BIOS setup.

--- Page 30 ---
Using BIOS setup26
To run BIOS setup, press the <F2> key immediately when the 
BenQ logo appears on the screen during system startup. The 
logo shows up on the screen for only a few seconds, so you must 
press the <F2> key at the time. The BIOS setup main screen will 
appear as follows.
The BIOS setup screen can be divided into four areas:
• On the top line is the menu bar containing the titles of 
available menus. Each menu title contains a specific menu.
• The center left column of the menu contains information 
regarding the current settings of the system. If you open a pull-
down menu and select an item that provides multiple options, 
the left column will display a submenu where you can make 
further selections.
• The right column of the menu contains Help information 
about the current menu selected. When a menu item is 
highlighted, more detailed information is given.
• The bottom lines of the menu provide keyboard instructions 
for moving around and making selections.

Recovering your system using QDataTrove in Windows XP 35
Protecting your nScreen from 
viruses and other security 
threats
Your nScreen may come pre-installed with an anti-virus 
software, which can help you avoid unexpected destruction of 
your precious data in the nScreen and keeps your privacy 
against any unauthorized access from other computers.
The anti-virus software protects your computer against Internet 
threats, such as viruses, Spyware, hackers, and spam. In 
addition, you can secure your personal information, block 
unwanted web sites, and check e-mail for viruses.
However, we would still recommend that you back up your data 
regularly on CDs, DVDs, or other external storage device, since 
the anti-virus software may not be able to intercept all existing 
and new viruses, which may lead to destruction of all or some of 
your data in the nScreen.
Furthermore, it is also recommended to set Windows to 
automatically install important updates for your nScreen. 
Important updates can bring you significant benefits, such as 
improved security and reliability.
For more information about how to use the anti-virus software 
installed, refer to the online help that comes with the software.
For more information about how to use Windows Update, refer 
to Start > Help and Support in Windows XP.

FAQ and troubleshooting
The chapter describes situations that you may encounter during 
use of the nScreen, along with basic troubleshooting steps. If 
you are not able to resolve the issue, contact a nearest BenQ 
service center for assistance immediately.
Power
I have pressed the Power button, but my nScreen cannot start 
up.
Check the Power button indicator.
• If it is not lit up, your nScreen is not being supplied by power 
from an external power source via the power adapter. Make 
sure you have connected the power adapter correctly to the 
power jack of your nScreen and a working power outlet.
• If the Power button indicator lights up in green, the 
nScreen is being supplied normally with power, 
meaning that the problem lies elsewhere.
• If you have added or replaced any hardware, such as a 
memory module, check if it has been installed 
correctly.
• It is possible that certain operating system files are 
damaged or missing. If so, you may need to back up all 
your data first, and then recover your system. Refer to 
"Recovering your system using QDataTrove in 
Windows XP" on page 29 for details.

Disable to disable WLAN to reduce interference of different 
network connection modes.
What is a Wireless LAN (WLAN)?
A WLAN is a type of Local Area Network (LAN) that uses high 
frequency radio waves rather than wires to communicate and 
transmit data among nodes. It is a flexible data communication 
system implemented as an extension to, or as an alternative for, 
a wired LAN within a building or campus

enable WLAN.
• In Windows XP, click the 
Start > Control Panel > Network 
and Internet Connection > Network Connections. 
Double-click 
Wireless Network Connection. 
Make sure the connection status is connected and with 
appropriate signal strength. If you do not see the connection 
status, make sure your wireless device is set up correctly so 
your nScreen can receive the signal.
• Make sure your wireless router or access point is broadcasting 
the SSID. Refer to your wireless device's documentation for 
enabling this broadcasting feature.
System
How should I resolve the "Low on Disk Space" or "Out of Disk 
Space" error messages in Windows XP?
Windows uses disk space for operations, such as caching and 
virtual memory. The nScreen may not run reliably if the free 
space of the hard disk drops under 100MB or 200MB. The 
following instructions will help you free up the disk space.
1. Click 
Start > My Computer.
2. Right-click the hard disk icon and then select 
Properties.
3. Observe how much free space is on the hard disk.
4. To free up the space of your hard disk, click 
Disk Cleanup 
and follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.
How do I update the driver?
Please visit BenQ Online Service and Support 
(http://www.benq.com/support/) to search for driver updates.
My system is running very slow. How can I improve the 
performance?
System resources are the amount of memory and hard disk 
space that your nScreen can use, which may degrade over time 
and affect the system performance. However, you can still 
improve the system performance by using the methods below.
• Close all open programs not being used. Use software 
programs that are absolutely necessary. Try running virus 
scans and other tools when you are not using your nScreen.

--- Page 47 ---
FAQ and troubleshooting 43
Closing software programs that are not necessary helps your 
system performs more efficiently.
• Prevent background software programs from loading. As 
software programs load the small icons in the notification area 
located at the lower right corner of the desktop, they will be 
running in the background and each one consumes valuable 
system resources. You can follow the steps below to prevent 
application programs from running when Windows launches:
1. Press  + R to display the 
Run dialog box.
2. Type "msconfig" in the 
Open field. The system 
configuration utility will appears.
3. Click the 
Startup tab, and then uncheck any task that 
is unwanted.
4. Click 
Apply, and then click OK. Restart your nScreen.
• Remove programs from the Startup folder. Removing 
programs from the Startup folder also helps prevent programs 
from running when Windows starts up. To do so, follow the 
steps below:
1. Right-click anywhere in the open area on the desktop 
and select 
New > Folder. Give the folder a name. This 
folder will be used later.
2. Right-click the 
Start button and then select Open. A 
folder named 
Programs will appear in the Start 
Menu window.
3. Double-click the 
Programs folder and then the 
Startup folder.
4. Right-click any icon in the folder and then select 
Properties. The information about the icon will 
appear.
5. You may decide if the program is necessary to be kept 
in the 
Startup folder. Select unwanted program icons, 
right-click on them and select 
Cut.
6. Close the open windows to return to the desktop.
7. Open the folder created in Step 1.
8. Select the 
Edit and Paste commands in the folder 
window. The icons that were cut from the 
Startup 
folder are now placed in the folder.
9. Restart the nScreen. The programs removed from the 
Startup folder will no longer run when Windows 
starts. However, you can still run them by double-
clicking their icons in the folder created in Step 1.
• Empty the Recycle Bin. You can free up disk space by clearing 
files you no longer need from the Recycle Bin. To do so, right-
click the 
Recycle Bin icon on the desktop and select Empty 
Recycle Bin.
• Delete temporary files and directories. This will increase the 
disk space of your hard disk, and reduce the time Window 
takes to access the hard disk. It will also help solve problems 
associated with spooling print job.
1. Close all running programs.
2. Click 
Start > All Programs > Accessories > 
System Tools > Disk Cleanup.
3. Select the drive you want to clean, and click 
OK.
4. Check the types of files you want to delete (temporary 
files are safe to delete).

There is no sound coming from the speakers.
Verify  the follow in g :
• The speakers may have been muted. Check the volume control 
(speaker icon) in the notification area located at the lower 
right corner of the desktop to see if the volume has been 
muted. If so, please restore the volume.
• The speakers may have been turned off, or the volume may 
have been set too low. Adjust the volume switch (also the 
Power button). Or check the volume control (speaker icon) in 
the notification area located at the lower right corner of the 
desktop, and adjust volume appropriately.
• An earphone or external speakers may have been connected to 
the audio output jack, turning off the nScreen's built-in 
speakers automatically.
Why is the hard disk capacity displayed by the OS different from 
its nominated capacity?
You may have discovered that the capacity of a 10GB hard disk 
becomes 9GB when displayed from the OS, and 20GB becomes 
19GB, etc. The bigger the capacity, the bigger the difference. It is 
because hard disk manufacturers and OS developers calculate

--- Page 49 ---
FAQ and troubleshooting 45
hard disk capacity in different ways. As a result, the nominated 
capacity is different from the exact capacity displayed by the OS.
Example of a 40GB hard disk:
Exact capacity of a 40GB hard disk displayed in the OS:
40,000,000,000÷1024÷1024÷1024=37.2529 (GB).
Furthermore, when a hard disk is partitioned, the system will 
reserve some space on the drive for system files. Therefore, the 
total capacity of a hard disk displayed by the OS will never be 
the same as its nominated capacity.
I hear noise when connecting an earphone to the nScreen.
Verify the following:
• Connect the earphone to other devices, such as a radio to see if 
you can still hear that noise. If the noise persists, the earphone 
may be out of order.
• If you can hear the noise only when inserting, it is the result of 
high instantaneous current. It is a normal phenomenon.
What should I do if a program on Windows freezes?
If your system freezes, press the <Ctrl> + <Alt> + <Del> keys 
simultaneously, click 
Applications under Windows Task 
Manager, and then right-click on the application that freezes 
and click 
End Task.
Why is my nScreen running so hot? Is it normal?
Yes. Because all the hardware is in such cramped quarters, it 
tends to get hot. To prevent overheating, do not obstruct the 
vent. For example, do not use the nScreen in bed where a 
blanket may inadvertently cover the vent and block the airflow.
Why does my nScreen seem to turn off itself after a certain 
period of inactivity?
This is the default setting of the nScreen to conserve power. The 
nScreen is configured to use the power saving feature. You can 
go to 
Start > Control Panel > Performance and 
Maintenance
 > Power Options in Windows to adjust the 
setting manually.
