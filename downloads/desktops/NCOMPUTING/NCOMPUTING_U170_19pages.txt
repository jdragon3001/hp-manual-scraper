Product overview 
 
The  NComputing  U170  kit  enables  users  to  dramatically  cut  computing  costs  by  sharing  the 
untapped  power  of  existing  computers.  The  U170  access  device  and  NComputing  vSpace 
software  work  together  to  efficiently  harness  excess  computing  capacity  and  enable  multiple 
users to share a single computer. And each user gets the full performance and capability of a 
PC,  including  multimedia  and  video.  Best  of  all,  IT  staff  and  end  users  do  not  need  special 
training because the solution is easy to setup and is compatible with standard PC software. 
 
 
Connect one user per kit or a total of 10 users per host machine 
 
 
With  the  NComputing  U170,  each  user  still  has  a  standard  monitor,  keyboard,  mouse,  and 
speakers (sold separately). However, instead of connecting directly to the PC, these peripherals 
connect to the U170 access device on their desk. These very small, solid-state devices connect 
with  USB  cables  and  optional  USB  2.0  hubs  to  the  shared  PC.  The  distance  between  the 
access  device  and  the  shared  computer  can  be  a  maximum  of  20  meters  (66  feet)  following 
standard USB 2.0 specifications on cables and hubs. The U170 can also be easily attached and 
secured to the back of a display with the built-in VESA mount option. 
 
The NComputing vSpace desktop virtualization software (included) divides the PC’s resources 
into independent virtual workspaces that give each user their own full PC experience. vSpace 
simplifies  configuration  by  automatically  assigning  the  keyboard,  mouse,  audio  and  any  USB 
devices  attached  to  each  workstation.  There  is  even  an  auto-login  feature  that  can  be  set  to 
automatically login a user making the U170 a great product for kiosks, schools, kids, and digital 
signage applications.

Minimum system requirements 
Host computer 
For multiuser applications the host computer operating system can be Windows Server 2003 R2 
SP2  (Standard  or  Enterprise  Edition,  32-bit),  Windows  Server  2008  SP2  (Standard  or 
Enterprise,  32-bit.  For  more  information  Microsoft  licensing  please  see  the  Important  Notices 
section at the beginning of this document.   
 
Almost  any  modern  PC  may  be  used  to  host  NComputing  vSpace  software.  The  guidelines 
below  are  a  good  rule  of  thumb  for  determining  how  many  users  you  can  expect  to  have  a 
native experience running general productivity software applications.   
 
 
 
 
The table below describes the maximum bandwidth of the USB bus for modern PC 
motherboards. Some PCs may contain multiple EHCI controllers that can double or 
triple the available bandwidth. These systems will have better video performance when 
running more than 4 U170 devices on a PC. To take advantage of multiple controllers, 
connect any downstream hubs back to the PC directly rather than connecting all U170s 
downstream of one USB connection. Adding an additional USB controller card to a PC 
is also an option for large deployments. 
 
Vendor   Chip Set   USB or EHCI controllers  Maximum Bandwidth 
AMD  SB710  2  120 MB/s 
Broadcom  HT1100  3  180 MB/s 
Intel  ICH8  2  120 MB/s 
Intel  ICH9  2  120 MB/s 
Intel  ICH10  2  120 MB/s 
nVIDIA  ION Series   2  120 MB/s 
* Note: This is NOT a comprehensive list of chip set that have more than one USB bus.  
Note: 
The U170 requires USB 2.0 controller
(
s
)
 for operation. 
In addition, some 
older PCs may have difficulty booting with U170 devices (or other high-speed 
USB audio devices) when attached. In these cases, you may need to boot the 
computer  first,  then  attach  the  USB  cable.  This  problem  can  sometimes  be 
resolved by installing a separate USB 2.0 PCI car
d into the PC.

Access devices 
For each U170 station you will need: 
•  USB keyboard and mouse 
•  Monitor (resolution support below) 
•  Optional: speakers, headphones, and/or microphone with mini stereo connector 
•  Optional: USB devices and USB cables (connect directly to host PC and can be 
assigned to each station via the vSpace software) 
Install the hardware 
Connect peripheral devices 
 
The U170 has two USB 2.0 connectors to support USB devices. These ports may be used in 
the following ways: 
•  USB Keyboard and Mouse 
•  Wireless Keyboard Adapter and an accessory port 
•  A separate USB Hub to support additional USB accessories

--- Page 9 ---
USB virtual desktop (model U170) user guide
 
 
 
Page 9
 
 
 
 
Connection options 
The U170 may be attached to a PC through any USB 2.0 compliant connection method. This 
includes the use of USB 2.0  hubs, USB  2.0  extension cables, and USB 2.0  active extenders. 
Each segment of a USB connection from device to host, device to hub, or hub to hub, must be 
no longer than 5 meters. The USB 2.0 specification states that a total of 4 hubs may be used 
downstream of a PC before the U170 device itself. Because the U170 is dependent on USB bus 
power,  a  powered  hub  should  always  be  used  directly  upstream  of  a  U170  when  not  directly 
attached to a PC. 
 
 
Note: USB devices (ex. Flash memory stick) connected downstream of a U170 
will be assigned to the session logged in to that U170 device.   
Note: 
T
he U170 device is powered
 by the USB bus and a single USB port can 
provide power for only one U170 device with a mouse and keyboard. Adding 
additional  USB  devices  immediately  downstream  of  the  U170  that  draw  too 
much power is likely to cause errors. Using a powered USB hub downstream 
from a U170 for high power peripherals is recommended.

Mounting and security 
Using two screws (provided) you can attach  the XD2 to  the back  of  an LCD  monitor that has 
VESA compliant mounting holes as shown below. To secure the U170 device, a slot has been 
provided in between the mounting screw holes to permit a security cable to be attached.   
 
 
Note:  P
erformance  may  be  impacted  by  poor  quality  cables  or  hubs.
  We 
recommend  USB  2.0  certified  cables  with  minimum  wires  sizes  of  AWG  24 
(power) and 28 AWG (signal). 
(Note, the higher the number the smaller the wire.)

User setup 
 
There are two options for setting up users on a multiuser system: 
1.  Local Users: for small installations, you can use the user management tool in Microsoft 
to add local users. 
2.  Workgroup or Domains: If there is already a workgroup or domain in use on the network, 
simply  join  the  computer  to  that  workgroup  or  domain  and  any  users  already  existing 
may use the new system. 
 
Note: 
The  Display on  the  host  system  wil
l  flash  on  and  off  during  the  video 
driver installation. It will repeat this for each new U170 being installed.   
Note: 
Users  must  be  joined  to  the  “Remote  Access”  group  in  a  multi
-
user 
system.  The  screens  below  show  where  to  find  the  user  management  and 
group management tools to setup new users.

Product registration 
 
The U170 USB virtual desktop and vSpace software that you install on a computer must be 
registered with NComputing. Prior to registration, user sessions will be limited to 60 minutes 
before timing out and requiring a reboot of the system. 
Registration is fast, easy and can be accomplished two ways:

--- Page 15 ---
USB virtual desktop (model U170) user guide
 
 
 
Page 15
 
1.  Online Registration 
2.  Offline Registration 
The Registration Wizard may be found on both the System Tray and in the start menu under 
“NComputing vSpace Software” 
 
Online registration 
 
If the PC where you have installed vSpace software has a connection to the internet for http and 
https, simply follow the registration wizard to:   
1.  Fill out your registration information.   
2.  Automatically discover the device serial numbers connected.   
3.  Then connect to the NComputing registration service . 
4.  If selecting this option, you may choose to enable “Background Registration” so that 
any time you install a new U170 to the system, the Registration Wizard will discover 
and register the product with your information without any user intervention. 
 
Offline registration 
 
If the PC where you have installed the U170 does not have access to the internet, you can still 
register the product. Simply:   
1.  Use the Registration Wizard and select “Offline Registration.”   
2.  The system will still automatically discover the connected devices, but will then allow 
you to save a registration file.

--- Page 16 ---
USB virtual desktop (model U170) user guide
 
 
 
Page 16
 
3.  Place this file in a location where you can access it with an email client. This may be 
on a flash disk if required.   
4.  Then send the file to registration@ncomputing.com where the request will be 
processed and a registration file will be sent back to you in email. 
5.  Once you have the returned file, restart the Registration Wizard and select 
“Complete Offline Registration”. 
 
PC upgrade or card migration to another PC 
The registration process assigns your vSpace software license and U170 virtual desktop to the 
specific host PC in which they are installed. If you change or upgrade multiple components on 
your PC, such as the  hard drive and operating system or if you move to another PC, you will 
need to re-assign your license to the new host PC configuration. When making such a change, 
simply repeat the online or offline registration process. You can reassign your license in this 
way  a  few  times  after  your  initial  registration.  If  you  exceed  this  limit  you  will  need  to 
contact NComputing technical support. 
 
Uninstallation 
To  uninstall  the  vSpace  software,  select  “Uninstall  vSpace” from  the “Start” menu. Follow  the 
prompts and the vSpace software is removed from the host PC. You will be prompted to restart 
the host PC to complete the process.

Page 17
 
  vSpace software updates 
 
 
Once  you have  successfully  completed the registration process, you can update the  software 
directly  over  the  Internet  by  selecting  “Update  vSpace”  from  the  “Start”  menu  or  from  the 
System Tray menu. (Provided those updates for which you may be entitled to are available).   
Additional features 
Auto login 
NComputing vSpace software has a convenient Auto-login feature popular in schools, kiosks, or 
digital  signage  applications.  If  enabled,  once  a  computer  boots,  each  U170  station  will 
automatically login using the username and password set. Additionally, a launch application or 
script may be specified to run at login. 
To enable the Autologin feature: 
1.  Click on Autologin setup 
 
2.  Enter the username and password you wish to use; the password will not be displayed in 
clear text. (Note a blank password can be used, to do this simply place the cursor into 
the password file (make no entries) and then press OK)

3.  Click the checkbox to “enable” 
The  “Running  Program”  fields  can  be  used  to  designate  a  single  application  to  be  displayed 
without  the  underlying  windowing  system.  This  may  be  used  for  kiosk  or  digital  signage 
applications. 
Troubleshooting guide 
 
No graphics are displayed of a U170 station 
If there is nothing being displayed on a U170 station check the following: 
1.  Is the blue light on the U170 on? If not, the device has not yet been enumerated to the 
PC. This could take up to 10-20 seconds if this is the first time connecting. 
2.  If the blue light is not on check to make sure the unit is plugged in to a USB 2.0 port. If 
connecting to a hub, make sure the hub is powered. 
3.  If the display is “gray” it is possible that you have not registered the device and it is timed 
out. Run the registration wizard.   
PC will not boot after attaching U170 virtual desktop 
Some older PCs have difficulty with USB 2.0 composite devices. There are two potential ways 
to solve 1) attach the U170 after booting, 2) try a separate USB PCI card 3) disable legacy USB 
support in the BIOS. 
 
U170 will not register 
Run the registration wizard, when the system scans and lists all of the connected U170 devices 
make sure the serial number of each device is displayed. If not, try unplugging and re-plugging 
the  U170  device,  wait  for  enumeration  and  press  refresh.  In  some  rare  cases,  it  may  be 
necessary to unplug the display connected to the U170 when registering devices. 
 
Sound does not play   
We setting up multiple U170 for the first time there are MANY items for the PC to discover and 
the  host  may  not  enumerate  all  devices  correctly  the  first  time.  Therefore  a  double  reboot  is 
advised  to  ensure  all  devices  are  enumerate  properly  (needed  only  after  new  devices  are 
added).   
 
Extended boot time to the OS   
When multiple U170’s are connected to the host the normal boot time will be extended some for 
each unit added. Remember the OS and PC is supporting that many more users.

Glossary 
 
Administrator: a person who is responsible for managing a multi-user computing environment, 
such as a local area network (LAN). Administrator responsibilities typically include: installing and 
configuring  system  hardware  and  software;  establishing  and  managing  user  accounts; 
upgrading software; and backup and recovery tasks. 
Download: the network transmission of a file from one computer system to another. 
Firewall: a set of related programs that protect the resources of a private network from users on 
other networks and control what outside resources local users have access to.   
Host PC: a computer in which the vSpace software has been installed 
Internet: a worldwide system of computer networks in which users at any one computer can, if 
they  have  permission,  get  information  from  other  connected  computers  (and  sometimes  talk 
directly with users at other computers). 
Log  on:  Logon  is  the  procedure  by  which  an  entity  (person,  program,  or  system)  exchanges 
credentials with an operating system or application in order to be allowed access to the OS or 
application.  Almost  always,  a  logon  requires  that  the  user  have  (1)  a  user  ID  and  (2)  a 
password. Often, the user ID must conform to a length requirement such as eight characters or 
more, and the password must contain at least one digit and not match a natural language word. 
User: one who uses a computer system. Users need to identify themselves to be able to access 
the  computer  system.  In  order  to  ensure  unique  identities,  the  system  administrator  usually 
assigns each user a username associated with a defined set of computer resources. 
USB: (Universal Serial Bus) is a standard designed to allow peripherals to connect and identify 
themselves a computer via a standardized interface socket. USB allows devices to connect and 
disconnect from a computer without the forcing the computer to be restarted.
