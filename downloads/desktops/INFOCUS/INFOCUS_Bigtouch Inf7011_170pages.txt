Wireless Network Precautions
PDP 5500, LED 5500 series and above
 
●
This TV supports the IEEE 802.11a/b/g /n communication protocols. Samsung recommends using 
IEEE 802.11n. Otherwise when you play video over a network connection, the video may not play 
smoothly.
 
●
To use a wireless network, the TV must be connected to a wireless router or modem. If the 
wireless router supports DHCP, the TV can use a DHCP or static IP address to connect to the 
wireless network.
 
●
Select a channel that is not currently in use for the wireless router. If the channel set for the 
wireless router is currently being used by another device, the result is usually interference and/or 
a communications failure.
 
●
Most wireless networks have an optional security system. To enable a wireless network's security 
system, you need to create a security key using characters and numbers. This security key is then 
needed to connect to the wireless network.

●
Encryption Types: WEP, TKIP, AES
If the wireless router has been set to Pure High-throughput (Greenfield) 802.11n mode and the 
Encryption Type to WEP or TKIP, Samsung TVs will not support the connection in compliance with the 
new Wi-Fi certification specifications. 
If the wireless router supports WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), it is possible to connect to the network 
using PBC (Push Button Configuration) or a PIN (Personal Identification Number). WPS automatically 
configures the SSID and WPA key settings.

Dynamic versus Static IP Addresses
If the network requires a dynamic IP address, use an ADSL modem or router that supports the 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Modems and routers that support DHCP automatically 
provide the IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS values the TV needs to access the Internet, so 
they do not have to be entered manually. Most home networks use a dynamic IP address.
If the network requires a static IP address, enter the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS values 
manually when setting up the network connection. To get the IP address, subnet mask, gateway and 
DNS values, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
If the network requires a static IP address, use an ADSL modem that supports DHCP. ADSL modems 
that support DHCP also allow static IP addresses.

SMART Interaction
This TV features SMART Interaction, which recognizes a user's voice, actions, and face to enable TV 
operations without the use of a remote control. The motion control and facial recognition features 
require a separately-sold camera installed on the TV. Make sure that the TV is connected to the 
Internet when installing the camera so that it can download the software required for motion control.
SMART Interaction makes it possible to configure settings and access features with ease. It takes 
approximately 15 seconds for voice and motion recognition to come online after turning on the TV.
 [
When connecting the TV camera to 2013 Samsung TV models, make sure to connect it to the 
specified USB port of the TV. Other USB ports are not supported for this purpose.
Precautions
Face Recognition
This product saves thumbnail images of users' faces for use during the Face Login. Logging into the 
Smart Hub via face recognition may be less secure than logging in using an ID and password.
TV Camera Use
Under some circumstances and under certain legal conditions, the use/misuse of the TV camera may 
result in legal liability. There may be obligations under local privacy laws regarding the protection of 
individuals concerning personal data and on the free movement of such data, and possibly other laws 
including criminal laws, regulating camera surveillance both in the workplace and elsewhere.
By using the TV camera, users agree that it will not be used (i) in locations where cameras are 
generally prohibited (such as bathrooms, locker rooms or changing rooms), (ii) in any manner that will 
result in an invasion of a person’s privacy or (iii) in violation of any applicable laws, regulations or 
statutes.
If you are using a camera, first check the back for a sticker.
Remove the sticker cover before adjusting the TV camera angle.
When you are no longer using the camera, rotate the lens downward and secure it in place. This 
prevents any inadvertent or unintentional camera operation.

Motion Control
Motion Control works by using the camera, so the user must be within the camera's recognition range. 
The camera's recognition range varies depending on the ambient light level and other factors. Run 
Motion Control Environment Test before using Motion Control to determine the camera's recognition 
range. User may experience physical fatigue when using Motion Control for extended periods.
Voice Recognition
Voice Recognition is not available in all languages, dialects or regions. The performance varies 
depending on the language chosen, voice volume and ambient noise levels in the surrounding area.
Voice Text Input requires the user's agreement with any third-party app’s voice privacy policy and to 
provide Samsung with the user's MAC address and other private information.
Voice Text Input lets users enter text using voice commands instead of a mouse, keyboard or remote 
control. This feature is particularly useful for searching, browsing the web, and using applications that 
require text input.
You must agree to the Supplemental Privacy Notices before using Interactive Voice Recognition.

Kensington Security Lock
A Kensington Security Lock is a physical device that can be used to protect the TV against theft. Look 
for the Kensington slot on the back of the TV. The slot has a 
K
 icon next to it. Wrap the lock around 
an object that is too heavy to carry and then thread it through the TV's Kensington slot. The lock, 
however, has to be purchased separately.
The method of using a Kensington Security Lock may differ for each TV model. Refer to the 
Kensington Security Lock manual for more information.

3D Precautions
Viewing guidelines
 
●
In 3D view mode, the screen may flicker under florescent lighting (50Hz ~ 60Hz) or three-wave 
lighting.
 "
In this case, it is advisable to turn off the lighting or adjust it to a low level.
 
●
When switching the picture mode from 3D view, the 3D view mode turns off, and the 3D Glasses 
fail to operate, resulting in the display not operating properly.
 "
Then, the 3D glasses turn off.
 
●
If you lie on your side while watching TV with the 3D glasses, the picture may look darker or 
may not be visible.
 
●
If the 3D glasses are defective or damaged, they cannot be repaired and should be exchanged for 
a new pair. The repair service is free of charge within the warranty period, which, however, does 
not cover damage from the user's fault.
 
●
The actual 3D effect may be experienced differently depending on the viewer. The 3D effect may 
not be experienced by a person who has a great difference of vision in the left and right eyes.
 
●
In 3D view mode, it is advisable to watch TV within the recommended distance.
 "
The 3D function of the glasses may not work properly if you are out of the recommended distance for 
about 3 seconds.
 "
If you stay out of the recommended range, the 3D glasses lose the wireless communications with the 
TV, and then the display turns off in few seconds before the glasses turn off.
 
●
The 3D glasses may not work properly if there are any nearby active 3D devices or electronic or 
wireless communication devices (for example, a device that uses the 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequency 
range such as a microwave or AP). In this case, move the devices away from the 3D glasses.
 
●
The 3D Glasses may not work properly near metal objects or in an electromagnetic field. In this 
case, move the metal objects or the electromagnetic device away from the 3D glasses.
 
●
The vividness of the image may be deteriorated if you watch TV in a location that is exposed to 
direct sunlight or illumination.
 
●
The temples of the 3D glasses are unfolded. Do not attempt to fold the temples with excessive 
force. This may damage the 3D glasses.
 
●
If you lie on your side while watching TV with the 3D glasses, the picture may look darker or 
may not be visible.
 
●
If watching 3D content for an extended time without averting your eyes elsewhere, the 3D glasses 
may turn off automatically. (for SSG-3570 models only)
 
●
Take off the 3D glasses and put them on again if it does not work in 3D view mode in the first 
place. (for SSG-3570 models only)

--- Page 157 ---

CAUTION!
IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY INFORMATION FOR 3D IMAGES. READ THE FOLLOWING 
CAUTIONS BEFORE YOU OR YOUR CHILD USE THE 3D FUNCTION.
 
●
Adults should frequently check on children who are using the 3D function. If there are any 
complaints of tired eyes, headaches, dizziness or nausea, stop the child from viewing the 3D TV 
and ensure that they rest.
 
●
Do not use the 3D glasses for any purpose other than the intended purpose, such as general 
eyeglasses, sunglasses, protective goggles.
 
●
Some viewers may experience discomfort such as dizziness, nausea and headaches while viewing 
3D TV. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop watching the 3D content, remove the 3D 
glasses, and take a rest.
 
●
An extended period of watching TV in 3D view mode may cause eye fatigue. In this case, stop 
watching the 3D content immediately, take off the 3D glasses and allow your eyes to rest.
 
●
Do not use the 3D function or the 3D glasses while walking or moving around. Wearing the 3D 
glasses while moving around may result in injury due to running into objects, tripping and/or 
falling.
 
●
If you sleep with the 3D glasses on, the temples on the glasses may become broken.
 
●
The temples of the 3D glasses are unfolded. Do not attempt to fold the temples with excessive 
force. Folding the temples with excessive force may damage the 3D glasses.
 
●
Do not shake your 3D glasses repeatedly. Shaking the glasses will power them on and can cause 
the battery to discharge faster than it should. (for SSG-3570 models only)

Troubleshooting
If the TV appears to have a problem, first review this list of possible problems and solutions. If none of 
the troubleshooting tips apply, visit www.samsung.com/support or contact Samsung Customer Service.
Screen
If there is a problem with the screen, run Picture Test (Support > Self Diagnosis > Picture Test) to 
diagnose the issue. If the test fails to identify a problem, there may be a problem with an external 
device or the signal strength.
There is something 
wrong with the TV.
Try this!
Flickering and Dimming
If your Samsung Television is flickering or dimming sporadically, you may need 
to disable some of the energy efficiency features. Disable Energy Saving (System 
> Eco Solution > Eco Sensor) and/or Energy Saving (System > Eco Solution > 
Energy Saving) and check again.
Component 
Connections/Screen 
Color
If you find that the color on your Samsung television screen is not correct or the 
black and white colors are off, run Self Diagnosis (Support > Self Diagnosis > 
Picture Test).
If the test results are negative, check the following:
Are the TV's video input connectors connected to the correct external device video 
output connectors?
Check other connections as well. If the TV is connected to an external device via a 
component cable, check that the Pb, Pr, and Y jacks are plugged into their proper 
connectors.
Screen Brightness
If you find that the colors on your Samsung TV are correct but just a little too dark 
or bright, try adjusting the following settings first.
Navigate to Picture and adjust Backlight/Cell Light (applicable models), Contrast, 
Brightness, Sharpness, Color, Tint (G/R) and other picture quality adjustment 
settings.
Auto Motion Plus/Blur
If you find that there is a blur or “ghost” shadow to the images on your television 
screen, you might be able to correct the issue using Auto Motion Plus (Picture > 
Picture Options > Auto Motion Plus).
Unwanted Powering 
Off
If your Samsung TV appears to turn off by itself, try disabling some of the TV's 
energy efficiency features. Check if Sleep Timer (System > Time > Sleep Timer) 
has been enabled. Sleep Timer automatically turns off the TV to save energy after 
a specified period of inactivity. If the Sleep Timer has not been enabled, see if No 
Signal Power Off (System > Eco Solution > No Signal Power Off) or Auto Power 
Off (System > Eco Solution > Auto Power Off) has been enabled.
Problems Powering On
When the TV is turned on, the remote control receiver flashes 5 times before the 
screen turns on.
If you find that you are having problems powering on your Samsung television, 
there are a number of things to check before calling the service department. If the 
power cord is connected properly and the remote control is operating normally, the 
problem might be with the antenna cable connection or the cable/satellite box not 
being turned on. Check the antenna connection or turn on the cable/satellite box.

There is something 
wrong with the TV.
Try this!
Unable to find a 
Channel
Run Setup (System > Setup) or Auto Program (Broadcasting > Auto Program).
The TV image does not 
look as good as it did 
in the store.
Store displays are all tuned to digital, HD (high definition) channels.
If you have an analog cable/set top box, upgrade to a digital set top box. Use 
HDMI or Component cables to deliver HD (high definition) picture quality.
Many HD channels are upscaled from SD (Standard Definition) content. Look for a 
channel that is broadcasting true HD content.
Cable/Satellite Subscribers: Try HD channels from the channel lineup.
Air/Cable Antenna Connection: Try HD channels after performing the Auto 
Program operation.
Adjust the cable/satellite box's video output resolution to 1080i or 720p.
The picture is distorted.
The compression of video content may cause picture distortions, especially in fast 
moving pictures such as sports and action movies.
A weak or bad quality signal can cause picture distortions. This is not an issue 
with the TV.
Mobile phones used close to the TV (within 1m) may cause noise in analog and 
digital channels.
The color is wrong or 
missing.
If you’re using a Component connection, make sure that the component cables are 
connected to the correct jacks. Incorrect or loose connections may cause color 
problems or a blank screen.
The color is poor or 
the picture is not bright 
enough.
Navigate to Picture and adjust Picture Mode, Brightness, Sharpness, Color, and 
other picture adjustment settings.
See if Energy Saving (System > Eco Solution > Energy Saving) has been enabled.
Try resetting the picture. (Picture > Reset Picture)
There is a dotted line 
on the edge of the 
screen.

Sound
If you find that there is a problem with the TV's speakers, run Sound Test (Support > Self Diagnosis > 
Sound Test) to diagnose the issue. If the audio is OK, the sound problem may be caused by the source 
or signal.
There is something wrong 
with the TV.
Try this!
There is no sound or 
the sound is too low at 
maximum volume.
Please check the volume of the device (cable/satellite box, DVD, Blu-ray, etc.) 
connected to your TV.
The picture is good but 
there is no sound.
Navigate to Sound and set Speaker Select to TV Speaker.
If you are using an external device, check the device’s audio output option. (For 
example, you may need to change your cable box’s audio option to HDMI if the 
box connected to your TV is using an HDMI cable.)
If you are using a DVI to HDMI cable, a separate audio cable is required.
If your TV has a headphone jack, make sure there is nothing plugged into it.
Reboot the connected device by disconnecting and then reconnecting the device’
s power cable.
The speakers are making 
an odd sound.
Make sure that the audio cable is connected to the correct audio output 
connector on the external device.
For antenna or cable connections, check the signal information. A low signal 
level may cause sound distortions.
Run Self Diagnosis (Support > Self Diagnosis > Sound Test).
3D TV
There is something wrong 
with the TV.
Try this!
The 3D Active Glasses 
are not working correctly.

look quite right.
The ideal viewing distance is three times or more the height of the screen.
We also recommend sitting with your eyes level with the screen.
The batteries in the 3D 
glasses don’t last.
Turn off the 3D glasses when you are not using them. If you leave the 3D glasses 
on, the battery lifespan is shortened.

Miscellaneous
There is something wrong 
with the TV.
Try this!
The TV is hot.
Watching TV for an extended period of time causes the panel to generate heat. 
The heat from the panel is dissipated through internal vents running along the 
top part of the TV. The bottom portion, however, may feel hot to the touch after 
extended use. Children watching TV need constant adult supervision to prevent 
them from touching the TV. This heat, however, is not a defect and does not 
affect the TV's functionality.
The picture won’t 
display in full screen.
HD channels will have black bars on either side of the screen when displaying 
upscaled SD (4:3) content.
Black bars will appear at the top and bottom of the screen when you watch 
movies that have aspect ratios different from your TV.
Adjust the picture size options on your external device or set the TV to full 
screen.
The "Mode Not 
Supported" message 
appears.
Check the supported resolutions of the TV and adjust the external device’s 
output resolution accordingly.
The Captions item in the 
TV menu is grayed out.
You cannot select the Caption menu if you have selected a source connected 
to the TV via HDMI or Component. The external device’s caption function must 
also be activated.
The TV smells of plastic. This smell is normal and will dissipate over time.
The TV's Signal 
Information option is 
not activated in the Self 
Diagnosis.
Verify that the current channel is a digital channel.
Signal Information is only available with digital channels. 
The TV is tilted to the 
side.
Remove the base stand from the TV and reassemble it.
Broadcasting is grayed 
out.
The Broadcasting menu is only available when Source is set to TV.
The Broadcasting menu cannot be accessed while watching TV using a cable 
box or satellite receiver.

There is something wrong 
with the TV.
Try this!
The settings are lost 
after 30 minutes or every 
time the TV is turned off.
If Use Mode is set to Store Demo, the TV's audio and video settings are 
automatically reset every 30 minutes.
Change Use Mode (Support > Use Mode) to Home Use.
There is an intermittent 
loss of audio or video.
Check the cable connections and reconnect them.
Loss of audio or video can be caused by using overly rigid or thick cables.
Make sure the cables are flexible enough for long term use. If you are mounting 
the TV to a wall, we recommend using cables with 90-degree connectors.
There are small particles 
on the TV's bezel.
This is part of the product’s design and is not a defect.
The PIP menu is not 
available.
PIP functionality is only available when you are using an HDMI or Component 
source.
A POP (TV’s internal 
banner ad) appears on 
the screen.
Change Use Mode (Support > Use Mode) to Home Use.
The TV is making a 
popping noise.
The expansion and contraction of the TV's outer casing may cause a popping 
noise. This does not indicate a product malfunction. The TV is safe to use.
The TV is making a 
humming noise.
Your TV utilizes high-speed switching circuits and high levels of electrical 
current, and depending on the brightness level being used may seem slightly 
noisier than a conventional TV.
Your TV has undergone strict quality control procedures that meet our 
demanding performance and reliability requirements.
Some noise coming from the TV is considered normal and is not an acceptable 
cause for an exchange or refund.
Image Retention (Burn 
In) Issue
This issue affects PDP TVs only. Watching TV for an extended period of time or 
using the 4:3 screen ratio only may result in burn-ins.
PDP TVs are equipped with Pixel Shift screen burn reduction technology. Pixel 
Shift technology reduces screen burn-ins in PDP TVs.
It does this by moving the picture slightly vertically or horizontally.
Use Screen Burn Protection (System > Screen Burn Protection) to prevent 
screen burn-ins.
