Top Case (Remove or replace) 
Removing the Top Case 
Before servicing your Thelio, be sure to power off and unplug all cords from the 
computer. 
   
Top Case removal is simple and requires, at most, a cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver.

Tools required: Fingers or Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 2 minutes
Difficulty: Easy
Screws: 4 total
- 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead).
Fig. 9: Thelio Outer Case views, front (left), back (middle), Top Case partial removal (right). 
   
 
Removing the lid will give you easy access to all components inside.  
To remove the lid, you’ll need to unscrew the 4 thumbscrews from the back of the Thelio.  
These thumbscrews will be on the top left and right, and bottom left and right of the back of the 
case. 
 
Do not unscrew any screws in the center of the panel here, as those screws correspond with 
parts inside; removing them will not assist you in removing the lid.  
System76 Thelio (thelio-b1)

--- Page 11 ---
All of Thelio’s thumbscrews are the same size, so don’t worry about mixing them up. And while 
a screwdriver is recommended for this procedure, it is not required. Once you have removed all 
4 thumb-screws from the back of the lid, lift the lid up and off of the chassis. Now you can 
proceed with servicing your machine.

This guide explains how to easily replace the Thelio’s Top Case after performing maintenance.

1. Align the grooves inside the case with the front of the Thelio frame (the side where the
power-button is located).
2. Once aligned, the case should easily slide down over the chassis.
3. Press down on the Top Case to make sure it is firmly seated, and the power button is
connected internally.
4. To ensure the case is seated correctly, plug the Thelio back into power, turn on the
power-supply switch and examine the front of the unit: the power button LED should light
up if you press it, and the system fans should spin to life.

4. Remove the GPU brace. Unscrew the bottom two screws, and then the top two screws, 
to remove the brace. Both the PCI bracket and the GPU brace keep your graphics card 
secure and in place (Fig 23). 
5. Remove the GPU from the PCIe slot by pressing on the release clip on the right. This is 
where your chosen (non-metal) poking tool may come in handy, to reach the clip on the 
board without trying to squeeze your hand between components. 
6. Disconnect the power cables from the GPU (if applicable), and tie back any cables you 
aren’t planning on using with the provided velcro straps. 
7. Now you are ready to install an alternative or replacement GPU. 
8. If you are not planning on installing another GPU follow the steps to Replace the CPU 
Cooler Shroud, Replace the Top Case, and reconnect all cables and peripherals.

4. Prepare the necessary power connectors for your graphics card. You can tell which 
wires you’ll need by looking at the ports on the front of your GPU. The necessary cabling 
is provided inside your Thelio’s chassis. 
5. Do not connect the cables to the GPU until it has been inserted in the PCIe slot and 
secured with the brackets. 
6. Connect the power cables to the GPU selecting the cables based on the number of pins 
(See NOTE below). 
 
 
Fig. 29: Power supply cables tied together with supplied velcro strap, above chassis fan. 
 
7. Wrap up any unused wires with the velcro strap and store those wires back in the 
chassis so that they’re not blocking the fan. 
System76 Thelio (thelio-b1)

--- Page 26 ---
NOTE: Some GPU's use the PCI-e slot for power and don't need a cable. If your Thelio is 
configured with a Radeon RX 550 graphics card, for example, you will not find any power 
connectors in your GPU. The cards compatible with this Thelio model require 8-pin, 12 
pin or 16-pin power cable connections. 
Fig. 30: Showing variations of pin connections on GPU cards - 8-pin (left), 12-pin (middle), 16-pin (right). 
 
8. Once the GPU is connected and the power cables secured, replace the Top Case, 
reconnect external power cable. 
9. Turn the power supply switch at the rear of the machine to the “on” position. 
Drives (Remove or replace) 
2.5” SATA Drives 
The thelio B1 provides four (4) slots for 2.5” SATA drives. They are 
housed in the Thelio Drive Cage for easy access. Each drive is 
connected to a SATA port on the Thelio IO board, which acts as a 
conduit, connecting the drives to the motherboard. 
 
M.2 Drives 
The Thelio B1 has two M.2 drive slots. One on the inside of the board, 
above the PCIe slot which holds the GPU, and one on the back of the 
unit on the outside of the board (pictured above). 
 
The internal M.2 storage drive is situated somewhat behind the GPU in the chassis. If you install 
an M.2 drive in this slot, you may need to remove the GPU beforehand to free up space. You 
can find video instructions on this process here. If your Thelio has only one M.2 drive, or do not 
have a GPU installed. You can simply unscrew the M.2 drive from the chassis, without needing 
to remove a GPU.

change the Thermal paste. Thermal paste helps transfer heat from the CPU to the CPU Cooler 
via the heat sink. 
 
Thermal paste can lose its effectiveness over time and may need to be removed and replaced 
from time to time. 
 
This guide will explain how to remove the CPU Cooler, clean the CPU of thermal paste, and 
reapply a new coat. 
 
Remove the CPU Thermal Paste 
Removing CPU thermal paste is straightforward but precise, involved, and requires removal of
the CPU Cooler Shroud. It may also require removing the GPU for easier access.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, Rubbing Alcohol, Paper Towels, Thermal
Paste.
Time estimate: 15-20 mins.
Difficulty: Hard
Screws: 12 total
- 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the Top Case.
- 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the CPU Cooler Shroud.
- 4 Bracket Screws securing the CPU heat sink.

1. Follow the steps in Removing the Top Case. 
2. Follow the steps in Removing the CPU Cooler Shroud. 
3. Follow the steps in Removing the GPU (if applicable). 
4. Gently but firmly separate the Cooling Fan from the Heat Sink (fig. 33). The fan is held 
on by clips which can be pried from the sides of the heatsink. 
5. Next, disconnect the power cables from the Cooling Fan. 
6. Remove the four (4) bracket screws fastening the Heat Sink to the board. Loosen the 
screws one at a time and moving from opposite corner to opposite corner across the 
Heat Sink. For example: first, top left screw, then bottom right screw (fig. 34). This 
ensures even pressure between the brackets and the motherboard. 
7. Lift the Heat Sink off of the motherboard. 
8. You’ll notice that there is Thermal Paste coating the bottom of the Heat Sink as well as 
the CPU core. 
9. Apply Rubbing Alcohol to a sheet of Paper Towel and wipe the Thermal Paste off of the 
bottom of the Heat Sink and CPU core until they are totally clean. 
10. If you are replacing the Thermal Paste, continue on to the section Replacing the CPU 
Thermal Paste (See Important NOTE below). 
11. Replace the Heat Sink over the CPU core. 
12. Re-fasten the Heat Sink screws, again using the opposite corner method described 
above. 
13. Follow the steps to Replace the GPU (if applicable). 
14. Follow the steps to Replace the CPU Cooler Shroud. 
15. Follow the steps to Replace the Top Case. 
 
NOTE: DO NOT use your Thelio without thermal paste. Steps 11-12 above are there simply 
to help you reassemble your machine if you are not yet ready to apply new Thermal Paste. 
Running the machine without Thermal Paste could result in overheating, system shutdowns and 
possibly damage to the internal components.

Replace the CPU Thermal Paste 
Removing CPU thermal paste is straightforward but precise, involved, and requires removal of
the CPU Cooler Shroud. It may also require removing the GPU for easier access.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, Thermal Paste.
Time estimate: 15-20 mins.
Difficulty: Hard
Screws: 12 total
- 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the Top Case.
- 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the CPU Cooler Shroud.
- 4 Bracket Screws securing the CPU heat sink.
 
1. Follow steps 1-9 in Removing the CPU Thermal Paste. 
2. Once the Heat Sink and CPU core are free of old Thermal Paste, apply new paste in a 
line down the middle of the CPU core (fig. 37). 
3. Once the paste is applied, replace the Heat Sink over top of it. The Heat Sink will spread 
the thermal paste across the CPU core, there is no need to spread it yourself. 
4. Re-fasten the four (4) screws on the Heat Sink. In fastening the screws, partially tighten 
them one at a time, and move diagonally to the opposite corner. For example, tighten 
the top-left screw halfway, then move to the bottom right, and tighten that halfway, and 
so on. This ensures even pressure between the brackets and the motherboard. 
5. Once the Heat Sink is fastened down, clip the CPU Cooling Fan back onto the Heat 
Sink. 
6. Reconnect the power cables to the CPU Cooling Fan. 
7. Follow the steps in Replacing the GPU (if applicable). 
8. Next, follow the steps in Replacing the CPU Cooler Shroud. 
9. Follow the steps in Replacing the Top Case. 
10. Reconnect all external cables and peripherals, and turn the Power Supply switch to the 
“on” position. 
11. Power on the Thelio to ensure successful boot.
