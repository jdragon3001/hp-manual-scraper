Multitasking:
 
To
 
allow
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
of
 
multiple
 
hard
 
drives
 
whenever
 
possible,
 
the
 
FDAT
 
module
 
is
 
written
 
as
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
multitasking
 
functions.
 
Each
 
drive
 
under
 
test
 
can
 
run
 
the
 
same
 
test
 
or
 
run
 
a
 
different
 
test
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
 
Each
 
subtest
 
is
 
written
 
to
 
handle
 
a
 
single
 
test
 
pass
 
and
 
all
 
test
 
variables
 
are
 
kept
 
track
 
of
 
in
 
a
 
structure
 
unique
 
for
 
each
 
drive
 
.
 
However,
 
when
 
testing
 
IDE
 
drives,
 
FDAT
 
will
 
not
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
of
 
IDE
 
drives
 
that
 
are
 
attached
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
IDE
 
cable.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
FDAT
 
is
 
testing
 
four
 
IDE
 
drives
 
on
 
a
 
PC,
 
it
 
will
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
on
 
drives
 
1
 
and
 
3
 
first
 
(master
 
drives),
 
then
 
perform
 
tests
 
on
 
2
 
and
 
4
 
(slave
 
drives).
 
FDAT
 
will
 
also
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
testing
 
on
 
a
 
master
 
and
 
slave
 
that
 
are
 
on
 
separate
 
IDE
 
cables,
 
but
 
will
 
not
 
perform
 
simultaneous
 
tests
 
on
 
a
 
master
 
and
 
slave
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
IDE
 
cable.
 
This
 
generally
 
increases
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
needed
 
to
 
test
 
multiple
 
IDE
 
drives.
 
Another
 
limitation
 
of
 
FDAT’S
 
multitasking
 
capability
 
is
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
Ultra
 
DMA
 
(UDMA).
 
Only
 
one
 
drive
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
can
 
access
 
the
 
UDMA
 
channel
 
and
 
the
 
UDMA
 
channel
 
buffer
 
must
 
be
 
kept
 
high
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
speed
 
advantage
 
over
 
other
 
data
 
transfer
 
modes.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
UDMA
 
channel
 
during
 
testing,
 
users
 
must
 
disable
 
the
 
multitasking
 
feature.
 
Destructive
 
vs
 
non-destructive
 
testing:
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
tests
 
found
 
in
 
FDAT
 
are
 
non-destructive.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
PCDR
 
will
 
preserve
 
any
 
data
 
that
 
is
 
present
 
on
 
the
 
tested
 
media
 
prior
 
to
 
beginning
 
any
 
destructive
 
operations
 
(i.e.
 
write
 
operations).
 
However,
 
users
 
can
 
run
 
certain
 
tests
 
in
 
destructive
 
mode
 
(i.e.
 
surface
 
scan
 
tests).
 
Destructive
 
tests
 
will
 
speed
 
up
 
testing
 
because
 
FDAT
 
does
 
not
 
preserve
 
the
 
data
 
on
 
the
 
media
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
test
 
beginning.
 
Unlike
 
non-destructive
 
tests,
 
any
 
data
 
present
 
on
 
the
 
media
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
test
 
beginning
 
is
 
lost.
 
FDAT
 
allows
 
for
 
enabling
 
or
 
disabling
 
destructive
 
tests,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
specifying
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
destructive
 
and
 
non-destructive
 
sectors
 
on
 
the
 
tested
 
drive.
 
This
 
is
 
done
 
through
 
the
 
configuration
 
of
 
the
 
FDAT.INI
 
.If
 
destructive
 
and
   
28

--- Page 35 ---
non-destructive
 
ranges
 
somehow
 
overlap,
 
then
 
the
 
overlapped
 
area
 
is
 
considered
 
non-destructive.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
users
 
specify
 
both
 
destructive
 
and
 
non-destructive
 
ranges
 
as
 
the
 
same,
 
then
 
the
 
entire
 
drive
 
is
 
tested
 
as
 
non-destructive.

Your
 
computer
 
has
 
a
 
special
 
type
 
of

that
 
maintains
 
the
 
date,
 
time,
 
and
 
settings
 
for
 
built-in
 
features,
 
such
 
as
 
parallel-port

(configuration).
 
A
 
battery
 
keeps
 
this
 
information
 
active
 
when
 
you
 
turn
 
off
 
the
 
computer.
 
The
 
battery
 
normally
 
requires
 
no
 
charging
 
or
 
maintenance
 
throughout
 
its
 
life;
 
however,
 
no
 
battery
 
lasts
 
forever.
 
If
 
the
 
battery
 
fails,
 
the
 
date,
 
time,
 
and

Internal
 
drives
 
are
 
devices
 
that
 
your
 
computer
 
uses
 
to
 
read
 
and
 
store
 
data.
 
You
 
can
 
add
 
or
 
replace
 
drives
 
to
 
your
 
computer
 
to
 
increase
 
storage
 
capacity
 
and
 
to
 
enable
 
your
 
computer
 
to
 
read
 
other
 
types
 
of
 
media
 
such
 
as
 
CD-ROM.
 
Internal
 
drives
 
are
 
installed
 
in
 
bays.

this
 
book,
 
the
 
bays
 
are
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
bay

and
 
so
 
on.
 
When
 
you
 
install
 
an
 
internal
 
drive,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
what
 
type
 
and
 
size
 
of
 
drive
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
install
 
in
 
each
 
bay.
 
Also,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
correctly
 
connect
 
the
 
internal
 
drive
 
cables
 
to
 
the
 
installed
 
drive.

serial
 
number
 
along
 
with
 
all
 
serialized
 
components
 
(for
 
example,
 
system
 
board,
 
riser
 
card,
 
memory,
 
and
 
processor).
 
At
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
computer
 
manufacture,
 
the
 
EPROM
 
will
 
be
 
loaded
 
with
 
the
 
serial
 
numbers
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
and
 
all
 
major
 
components.
 
A
 
company
 
called
 
Retain-a-Group
 
is
 
a
 
central
 
data
 
warehouse
 
offering
 
serial
 
number
 
data
 
management.
 
Retain-a-Group
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
focal
 
point
 
to
 
law
 
enforcement.
 
The
 
customer
 
has
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
purchase
 
serial
 
number
 
information
 
and
 
services
 
from
 
Retain-a-Group.
 
It
 
is
 
the
 
customer’s
 
responsibility
 
to
 
maintain
 
the
 
MIF
 
file
 
and
 
to
 
inform
 
Retain-a-Group
 
of
 
any
 
changes
 
to
 
the
 
file.
 
Some
 
customers
 
may
 
request
 
their
 
servicers
 
to
 
assist
 
them
 
in
 
maintaining
 
the
 
MIF
 
file
 
when
 
serialized
 
components
 
are
 
replaced
 
during
 
hardware
 
service.
 
This
 
assistance
 
is
 
between
 
the
 
customer
 
and
 
the
 
servicer.
 
The
 
servicer
 
can
 
use
 
the
 
DMI
 
MIF
 
Browser
 
to
 
update
 
the
 
MIF
 
information
 
in
 
the
 
EPROM.
 
It
 
is
 
anticipated
 
that
 
some
 
servicers
 
might
 
charge
 
for
 
this
 
service.
 
To
 
update
 
the
 
EPROM
 
using
 
the

damage,
 
disconnect
 
the
 
attached
 
power
 
cords,
 
telecommunication
 
systems,
 
networks,
 
and
 
modems
 
before
 
you
 
open
 
the
 
server/workstation
 
covers,
 
unless
 
instructed
 
otherwise
 
in
 
the
 
installation
 
and
 
configuration
 
procedures.
 
Observe
 
the
 
following
 
rules
 
when
 
working
 
on
 
electrical
 
equipment.
 
Important:
  
Use
 
only
 
approved
 
tools
 
and
 
test
 
equipment.
 
Some
 
hand
 
tools
 
have
 
handles
 
covered
 
with
 
a
 
soft
 
material
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
insulate
 
you
 
when
 
working
 
with
 
live
 
electrical
 
currents.
 
Many
 
customers
 
have,
 
near
 
their
 
equipment,
 
rubber
 
floor
 
mats
 
that
 
contain
 
small
 
conductive
 
fibers
 
to
 
decrease
 
electrostatic
 
discharges.
 
Do
 
not
 
use
 
this
 
type
 
of
 
mat
 
to
 
protect
 
yourself
 
from
 
electrical
 
shock.

(EPO)
 
switch,
 
disconnecting
 
switch,
 
or
 
electrical
 
outlet.
 
If
 
an
 
electrical
 
accident
 
occurs,
 
you
 
can
 
then
 
operate
 
the
 
switch
 
or
 
unplug
 
the
 
power
 
cord
 
quickly.
 
v
   
Do
 
not
 
work
 
alone

all
 
power
 
before:
 
–
   
Performing
 
a
 
mechanical
 
inspection
 
–
   
Working
 
near
 
power
 
supplies
 
–
   
Removing
 
or
 
installing
 
main
 
units
v
   
Before
 
you
 
start
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
the
 
machine,
 
unplug
 
the
 
power
 
cord.
 
If
 
you
 
cannot
 
unplug
 
it,
 
ask
 
the
 
customer
 
to
 
power-off
 
the
 
wall
 
box
 
that
 
supplies
 
power
 
to
 
the
 
machine
 
and
 
to
 
lock
 
the
 
wall
 
box
 
in
 
the
 
off
 
position.
 
v
   
If
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
a
 
machine
 
that
 
has
 
exposed
 
electrical
 
circuits,
 
observe
 
the
 
following
 
precautions:
 
–
   
Ensure
 
that
 
another
 
person,
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
power-off
 
controls,
 
is
 
near
 
you.
 
Remember:
 
Another
 
person
 
must
 
be
 
there
 
to
 
switch
 
off
 
the
 
power,
 
if
 
necessary.
 
–
   
Use
 
only
 
one
 
hand
 
when
 
working
 
with
 
powered-on
 
electrical
 
equipment;
 
keep
 
the
 
other
 
hand
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
or
 
behind
 
your
 
back.
 
Remember:
 
There
 
must
 
be
 
a
 
complete
 
circuit
 
to
 
cause
 
electrical
 
shock.
 
By
 
observing
 
the
 
above
 
rule,
 
you
 
may
 
prevent
 
a
 
current
 
from
 
passing
 
through
 
your
 
body.
 
–
   
When
 
using
 
testers,
 
set
 
the
 
controls
 
correctly
 
and
 
use
 
the
 
approved
 
probe
 
leads
 
and
 
accessories
 
for
 
that
 
tester.
 
–
   
Stand
 
on
 
suitable
 
rubber
 
mats
 
(obtained
 
locally,
 
if
 
necessary)
 
to
 
insulate
 
you
 
from
 
grounds
 
such
 
as
 
metal
 
floor
 
strips
 
and
 
machine
 
frames.
 
Observe
 
the
 
special
 
safety
 
precautions
 
when
 
you
 
work
 
with
 
very
 
high
 
voltages;
 
these
 
instructions
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
safety
 
sections
 
of

information.
 
Use
 
extreme
 
care
 
when
 
measuring
 
high
 
voltages.

Safety
 
inspection
 
guide
 
The
 
intent
 
of
 
this
 
inspection
 
guide
 
is
 
to
 
assist
 
you
 
in
 
identifying
 
potentially
 
unsafe
 
conditions
 
on
 
these
 
products.
 
Each
 
machine,
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
designed
 
and
 
built,
 
had
 
required
 
safety
 
items
 
installed
 
to
 
protect
 
users
 
and
 
service
 
personnel
 
from
 
injury.
 
This
 
guide
 
addresses
 
only
 
those
 
items.
 
However,
 
good
 
judgment
 
should
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
identify
 
potential
 
safety
 
hazards
 
due
 
to
 
attachment
 
of
 
non-IBM
 
features
 
or
 
options
 
not
 
covered
 
by
 
this
 
inspection
 
guide.
 
If
 
any
 
unsafe
 
conditions
 
are
 
present,
 
you
 
must
 
determine
 
how
 
serious
 
the
 
apparent
 
hazard
 
could
 
be
 
and
 
whether
 
you
 
can
 
continue
 
without
 
first
 
correcting
 
the
 
problem.
 
Consider
 
these
 
conditions
 
and
 
the
 
safety
 
hazards
 
they
 
present:
 
v
   
Electrical
 
hazards,
 
especially
 
primary
 
power
 
(primary
 
voltage
 
on
 
the
 
frame
 
can
 
cause
 
serious
 
or
 
fatal
 
electrical
 
shock).
 
v
   
Explosive
 
hazards,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
damaged
 
CRT
 
face
 
or
 
bulging
 
capacitor
 
v
   
Mechanical
 
hazards,
 
such
 
as
 
loose
 
or
 
missing
 
hardware
 
The
 
guide
 
consists
 
of
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
steps
 
presented
 
in
 
a
 
checklist.

Handling
 
electrostatic
 
discharge-sensitive
 
devices
 
Any
 
computer
 
part
 
containing
 
transistors
 
or
 
integrated
 
circuits
 
(ICs)
 
should
 
be
 
considered
 
sensitive
 
to
 
electrostatic
 
discharge
 
(ESD).
 
ESD
 
damage
 
can
 
occur
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
difference
 
in
 
charge
 
between
 
objects.
 
Protect
 
against
 
ESD
 
damage
 
by
 
equalizing
 
the
 
charge
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
machine,
 
the
 
part,
 
the
 
work
 
mat,
 
and
 
the
 
person
 
handling
 
the
 
part
 
are
 
all
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
charge.
 
Notes:
  
1.
   
Use
 
product-specific
 
ESD
 
procedures
 
when
 
they
 
exceed
 
the
 
requirements
 
noted
 
here.
 
2.
   
Make
 
sure
 
that
 
the
 
ESD
 
protective
 
devices
 
you
 
use
 
have
 
been
 
certified
 
(ISO
 
9000)
 
as
 
fully
 
effective.
 
When
 
handling
 
ESD-sensitive
 
parts:
 
v
   
Keep
 
the
 
parts
 
in
 
protective
 
packages
 
until
 
they
 
are
 
inserted
 
into
 
the
 
product.
 
v
   
Avoid
 
contact
 
with
 
other
 
people.
 
v
   
Wear
 
a
 
grounded
 
wrist
 
strap
 
against
 
your
 
skin
 
to
 
eliminate
 
static
 
on
 
your
 
body.
 
v
   
Prevent
 
the
 
part
 
from
 
touching
 
your
 
clothing.
 
Most
 
clothing
 
is
 
insulative
 
and
 
retains
 
a
 
charge
 
even
 
when
 
you
 
are
 
wearing
 
a
 
wrist
 
strap.
 
v
   
Use
 
the
 
black
 
side
 
of
 
a
 
grounded
 
work
 
mat
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
static-free
 
work
 
surface.
 
The
 
mat
 
is
 
especially
 
useful
 
when
 
handling
 
ESD-sensitive
 
devices.
 
v
   
Select
 
a
 
grounding
 
system,
 
such
 
as
 
those
 
listed
 
below,
 
to
 
provide
 
protection
 
that
 
meets
 
the
 
specific
 
service
 
requirement.
 
Note:
  
The
 
use
 
of
 
a
 
grounding
 
system
 
is
 
desirable
 
but
 
not
 
required
 
to
 
protect
 
against
 
ESD
 
damage.
 
–
   
Attach
 
the
 
ESD
 
ground
 
clip
 
to
 
any
 
frame
 
ground,
 
ground
 
braid,
 
or
 
green-wire
 
ground.
 
–
   
Use
 
an
 
ESD
 
common
 
ground
 
or
 
reference
 
point
 
when
 
working
 
on
 
a
 
double-insulated
 
or
 
battery-operated
 
system.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
coax
 
or
 
connector-outside
 
shells
 
on
 
these
 
systems.
 
–
   
Use
 
the
 
round
 
ground-prong
 
of
 
the
 
ac
 
plug
 
on
 
ac-operated
 
computers.
