Working on Your Computer
Before Working Inside Your Computer
Use the following safety guidelines to help protect your computer from potential damage and to help to 
ensure your personal safety. Unless otherwise noted, each procedure included in this document assumes 
that the following conditions exist:
• You have read the safety information that shipped with your computer.
• A component can be replaced or--if purchased separately--installed by performing the removal 
procedure in reverse order.
WARNING: Disconnect all power sources before opening the computer cover or panels. After you 
finish working inside the computer, replace all covers, panels, and screws before connecting to 
the power source.
WARNING: Before working inside your computer, read the safety information that shipped with 
your computer. For additional safety best practices information, see the Regulatory Compliance 
Homepage at 
www.dell.com/regulatory_compliance 
CAUTION: Many repairs may only be done by a certified service technician. You should only 
perform troubleshooting and simple repairs as authorized in your product documentation, or as 
directed by the online or telephone service and support team. Damage due to servicing that is 
not authorized by Dell is not covered by your warranty. Read and follow the safety instructions 
that came with the product.
CAUTION: To avoid electrostatic discharge, ground yourself by using a wrist grounding strap or 
by periodically touching an unpainted metal surface, such as a connector on the back of the 
computer.
CAUTION: Handle components and cards with care. Do not touch the components or contacts 
on a card. Hold a card by its edges or by its metal mounting bracket. Hold a component such as a 
processor by its edges, not by its pins.
CAUTION: When you disconnect a cable, pull on its connector or on its pull-tab, not on the cable 
itself. Some cables have connectors with locking tabs; if you are disconnecting this type of cable, 
press in on the locking tabs before you disconnect the cable. As you pull connectors apart, keep 
them evenly aligned to avoid bending any connector pins. Also, before you connect a cable, 
ensure that both connectors are correctly oriented and aligned.
NOTE: The color of your computer and certain components may appear differently than shown in 
this document.

CAUTION: Before touching anything inside your computer, ground yourself by touching an 
unpainted metal surface, such as the metal at the back of the computer. While you work, 
periodically touch an unpainted metal surface to dissipate static electricity, which could 
harm internal components.
