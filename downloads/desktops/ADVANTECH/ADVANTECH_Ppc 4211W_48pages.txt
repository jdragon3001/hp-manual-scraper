Safety Precaution - Static Electricity
Follow these simple precautions to protect yourself from harm and the products from
damage.
 To avoid electrical shock, always disconnect the power from your PC chassis 
before you work on it. Don't touch any components on the CPU card or other 
cards while the PC is on.
 Disconnect power before making any configuration changes. The sudden rush 
of power as you connect a jumper or install a card may damage sensitive elec-
tronic components.
Battery Information
Batteries, battery packs and accumulators should not be disposed of as unsorted
household waste. Please use the public collection system to return, recycle, or treat
them in compliance with the local regulations.

1.1 Introduction
The PPC-4211W is a new generation Panel PC with WXGA (1920 x 1080) screen.
The system is equipped with a high performance Intel Core i CPU and with a high
efficiency fanless thermal design the heat is easily dissipated. This gives HMI a big
step forward in consolidating performance and reliability in one system. Besides, with
multiple I/O ports (five COM, five USB and two Gigabit ethernet) its easier to connect
to devices and be integrated into machine building industry. In addition, PCIe/PCI
expansion allows users to add-on field bus or proprietary cards making more applica-
tions possible. Last but not least, the multi-touch screen makes the HMI more intui-
tive, and brings you the best operating experience.
