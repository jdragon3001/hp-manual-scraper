Product Warranty (2 years)
Advantech warrants to you, the original purchaser, that each of its products will be
free from defects in materials and workmanship for two years from the date of pur-
chase. 
This warranty does not apply to any products which have been repaired or altered by
persons other than repair personnel authorized by Advantech, or which have been
subject to misuse, abuse, accident or improper installation. Advantech assumes no
liability under the terms of this warranty as a consequence of such events.
Because of Advantech’s high quality-control standards and rigorous testing, most of
our customers never need to use our repair service. If an Advantech product is defec-
tive, it will be repaired or replaced at no charge during the warranty period. For out-
of-warranty repairs, you will be billed according to the cost of replacement materials,
service time and freight. Please consult your dealer for more details.
If you think you have a defective product, follow these steps:
1. Collect all the information about the problem encountered. (For example, CPU 
speed, Advantech products used, other hardware and software used, etc.) Note 
anything abnormal and list any onscreen messages you get when the problem 
occurs.
2. Call your dealer and describe the problem. Please have your manual, product, 
and any helpful information readily available.
3. If your product is diagnosed as defective, obtain an RMA (return merchandise 
authorization) number from your dealer. This allows us to process your return 
more quickly.
4. Carefully pack the defective product, a fully-completed Repair and Replacement 
Order Card and a photocopy proof of purchase date (such as your sales receipt) 
in a shippable container. A product returned without proof of the purchase date 
is not eligible for warranty service.

2.1 Introduction
The following sections show the internal jumpers settings and the external connector
pin assignments for application.
2.2 Jumpers 
2.2.1 Jumper Description
You may configure ARK-1124 to match the needs of your application by setting jump-
ers. A jumper is a metal bridge used to close an electric circuit. It consists of two
metal pins and a small metal clip (often protected by a plastic cover) that slides over
the pins to connect them. To close a jumper, you connect the pins with the clip. To
open a jumper, you remove the clip. Sometimes a jumper will have three pins,
labeled 1, 2 and 3. In this case you would connect either pins 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
The jumper settings are schematically depicted in this manual as follows.
A pair of needle-nose pliers may be helpful when working with jumpers. If you have
any doubts about the best hardware configuration for your application, contact your
local distributor or sales representative before you make any changes. Generally, you
simply need a standard cable to make most connections.

ARK-1124 User Manual 72
B.1 SUSI API Introduction
To make hardware easier and more convenient to access for programmers, Advan-
tech has released a suite of API (Application Programming Interface) in the form of a
program library. The program Library is called Secured and Unified Smart Interface
or SUSI for short.
SUSI provides a uniform API for application programmers to access the hardware
functions in different Operating Systems and on different Advantech hardware plat-
forms.
Application programmers can invoke the functions exported by SUSI instead of call-
ing the drivers directly. The benefit of using SUSI is portability. The same set of APIs
is defined for different Advantech hardware platforms. Also, the same API set is
implemented in different Operating Systems. This user's manual describes some
sample programs and the API in SUSI. The hardware functions currently supported
by SUSI can be grouped into a few categories including Watchdog and Hardware
Monitor. Each category of API in SUSI is briefly described below.
B.1.1 The Watchdog API
A watchdog timer (abbreviated as WDT) is a hardware device which triggers an
action, e.g. rebooting the system, if the system does not reset the timer within a spe-
cific period of time. The WDT API in SUSI provides developers with functions such as
starting the timer, resetting the timer, and setting the timeout value if the hardware
requires customized timeout values.
B.1.2 The Hardware Monitor API
The hardware monitor (abbreviated as HWM) is a system health supervision capabil-
ity achieved by placing certain I/O chips along with sensors for inspecting the target
of interests for certain condition indexes, such as temperature and voltage etc. 
However, due to the inaccuracy among many commercially available hardware mon-
itoring chips, Advantech has developed a unique scheme for hardware monitoring -
achieved by using a dedicated micro-processor with algorithms specifically designed
for providing accurate, real-time and reliable data content; helping protect your sys-
tem in a more reliable manner.
