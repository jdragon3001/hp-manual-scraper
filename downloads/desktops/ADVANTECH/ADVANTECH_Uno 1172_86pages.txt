Energy Star
An ENERGY STAR qualified computer delivers substantial savings over 
a conventional computer. Desktop, integrated desktop, and notebook (lap-
top) computers, workstations, small-scale servers, and thin clients are all 
eligible to earn the ENERGY STAR, and those that do are now more effi-
cient than ever. It is an honor for Advantech to provide you such prod-
ucts.
 What is ENERGY STAR?
 ENERGY STAR is a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) vol-
untary program that helps businesses and individuals save money and 
protect our climate through superior energy efficiency.
The ENERGY STAR program was established by EPA in 1992, under the 
authority of the Clean Air Act Section 103(g). Section103(g) of the Clean 
Air Act directs the Administrator to "conduct a basic engineering 
research and technology program to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate 
non–regulatory strategies and technologies for reducing air pollution."

--- Page 5 ---
v
In 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act. Section 131 of the Act 
amends Section 324 (42 USC 6294) of the Energy Policy and Conserva-
tion Act, and "established at the Department of Energy and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency a voluntary program to identify and promote 
energy–efficient products and buildings in order to reduce energy con-
sumption, improve energy security, and reduce pollution through volun-
tary labeling of or other forms of communication about products and 
buildings that meet the highest energy efficiency standards."

Hazardous locations are areas where fire or explosions may occur in nor-
mal or abnormal conditions because of the presence of flammable sub-
stances (e.g. gas, vapors, liquids, dust, fibers). Ignition sources, oxidizers 
and flammable substance are three basic and essential elements of an 
explosion. Any electrical apparatus installed in such location must be 
designed and tested to ensure that it can't initiate a fire or an explosion 
due to its hot surface, failure, arcs or impact sparks. Advantech's UNO-
1100 H series are certified to be used on the Class I Division 2 Groups A, 
B, C and D Hazardous Locations. This series provides safe and reliable 
controllers to be operated in hazardous locations. The proof of the certifi-
cation extends UNO-1100H series to many Oil and Gas applications

1.3  Safety Precautions
The following sections tell how to make each connection. In most cases, 
you will simply need to connect a standard cable. All of the connector pin 
assignments are shown in Appendix A.
Warning! Always disconnect the power cord from your  chassis 
when you are working on it. Do not connect while the 
power is on. A sudden rush of power can damage sen-
sitive electronic components. Only experienced elec-
tronics personnel should open the chassis.
Caution! Always ground yourself to remove any static electric 
charge before touching UNO-1172A/AE/AH. Modern 
electronic devices are very sensitive to static electric 
charges. Use a grounding wrist strap at all times. 
Place all electronic components on a static-dissipative 
surface or in a static-shielded bag.

2.2  RS-232 Interfaces
The UNO-1172A reserves two standard RS-232 serial communication 
pin headers on mother board (CN27 and CN28). Please refer to A.3 for 
pin assignments.
2.3  COM1~2: RS-232/422/485 Interfaces
The UNO-1172A offers two RS-232/422/485 serial communication inter-
face ports. The serial communication can be configured to either RS-232, 
RS422/485 by using on-board jumper. Please refer to A.4 for pin assign-
ments and Table 2.1 lists the default setting of each port.
2.3.1 SMSC SCH3114 UARTs with 16-byte Standard
Advantech UNO-1172A comes standard with SMSC SCH3114 UARTs 
containing 16 bytes FIFOs. These upgraded FIFOs greatly reduce CPU 
overhead and are an ideal choice for heavy multitasking environments.
2.3.2 Jumperless RS-422/485
In RS-422/485 mode, UNO-1172A automatically sense signals to match 
RS-422 or RS-485 network. No need to change jumpers.
2.3.3 Automatic Data Flow Control Function for RS-485
In RS-485 mode, UNO-1172A automatically senses the direction of 
incoming data and switches its transmission direction accordingly. There-
fore no handshaking signal (e.g. RTS signal) is necessary. This feature 
lets you simply and quickly build an RS-485 network with just two wires. 
More importantly, application software previously written for half duplex 
RS-232 environments can be reused without modification.

2.3.4 RS-232/422/485 Selection
COM1~2 support 9-wire RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485 interfaces, and you 
can set corresponding jumpers to select serial ports as RS-232 or RS-422/
485 interfaces shown in Table 2.2. Please note to reset the system to adapt 
this configuration change 
The system detects RS-422 or RS-485 signals automatically in RS-422/

2.3.5 Terminal Resistor Setup for RS-422/485
The onboard termination resistor (120 Ohm) for COM1/COM2 can be 
used for long distance transmission or device matching. (Default Off.) 
Each terminal resistor responds to different channels for RS-422/485.
Usually, these resistors are needed for both ends of the communication 
wires and the value of the resistors should match the characteristic imped-
ance of the wires used.
2.3.6 RS-485 Auto Flow & RS-422 Master/Slave Mode
You can set the “Auto Flow Control” mode of RS-485 or “Master/Slave” 
mode of RS-422 by using the SW5 DIP switch for each RS-422/485 port.
In RS-485, if the switch is set to “Auto”, the driver automatically senses 
the direction of the data flow and switches the direction of transmission. 
No handshaking is necessary.
In RS-422, if DIP switch is set to “On,” the driver is always enabled, and 
always in high or low status.

application
 
without a
 
monitor display), it is 
always
 
difficult
 
to
 
know the system status. Another
 
PC
 
may be needed to 
monitor a headless device's status via RS-232 or
 
Ethernet. In
 
order
 
to 
solve this problem, UNO-1172A offers
 
a programmable LED
 
indicator 
i.e. 
R. BTR, B. BTR, TEMP. and VOLT
.
 
In the BIOS settings, they can be 
programmed
 
to show systems status through
 
LED indicators and buzzer
 
alarms.

fics.
<2> In diagnostic LED mode, you could program them as an indicator 
showing the situation of signal from DI/DO you may set and monitor 
their status.Please refer to the user manual in DI/O driver folder for more 
details.
<3> In PCIe Mini Card LED mode, they show the status of PCIe mini 
card basically.

2.15.1 PIN Assignments
The UNO-1172A series have 2 DI channels designated DI0~DI1.The 
connector type is a plug-in screw terminal block that enables you to con-
nect to field I/O devices directly without additional accessories. Figure 
2.9 and shows its pin assignment as well as signal description.
Figure 2.9: Digital In
Each of digital input channels accepts 0 ~ 50 V
DC
 voltage inputs, and 
accepts bi-directional input. The voltage range is -3 ~ 3 V
DC
 for logic 0 
(low), -50 ~ -10 V
DC
 and 10 ~ 50 V
DC
 for logic 1(high). It means that 
you can apply positive or negative voltage to an isolated input pin (Vin).

--- Page 35 ---

2.15.2 Interrupt Function of the DI Signals
DI0 and DI1 can be used to generate hardware interrupts. Users can setup 
the configuration of them by programming the interrupt control register.
The channels are connected to the interrupt circuitry. Users can disable/
enable interrupt function, select trigger type or latch the port data by set-
ting the Interrupt Control Register of the UNO-1172A (refer to section 
2.15.3 below). When the interrupt request signals occur, then the software 
will service these interrupt requests by ISR (Interrupt Service Routine). 
The multiple interrupt sources provide the card with more capability and 
flexibility.
2.15.3 Interrupt Control Register
The Interrupt Control Register controls the function and status of each 
interrupt signal source. Appendix C shows the bit map of the Interrupt 
Control Register. The register is readable/writeable register. While being 
written, it is used as a control register; and while being read, it is used as a 
status register.

OFFSET = 0x010
WDTTR saves the occurrence times of watchdog timer time-out. The cor-
responding operation differs from the access type which is taken on 
WDTTR. A read-out from WDTTR would clear the watchdog interrupt 
while a write-in clear WDTTR.

In hazardous locations, sparks caused by the movement from a USB connec-
tor which is even slightly loose could lead to a disaster. To prevent this, we 
provide a set of accessories to secure the USB connectors. Follow the below 
instructions to complete the installation. (The contents may vary but the 
installation procedure is the same.)
1. Find the USB holders (5pcs in total) in the accessory bag.
2. Refer to the following figures and attach the holders to the 
UNO-1172AH for securing the USB connector.
