persons other than repair personnel authorized by Advantech, or which have been
subject to misuse, abuse, accident or improper installation. Advantech assumes no
liability under the terms of this warranty as a consequence of such events.
Because of Advantech’s high quality-control standards and rigorous testing, most of

1. Collect all the information about the problem encountered. (For example, CPU 
speed, Advantech products used, other hardware and software used, etc.) Note 
anything abnormal and list any onscreen messages you get when the problem 
occurs.
2. Call your dealer and describe the problem. Please have your manual, product, 
and any helpful information readily available.
3. If your product is diagnosed as defective, obtain an RMA (return merchandize 
authorization) number from your dealer. This allows us to process your return 
more quickly.
4. Carefully pack the defective product, a fully-completed Repair and Replacement 
Order Card and a photocopy proof of purchase date (such as your sales receipt) 
in a shippable container. A product returned without proof of the purchase date

3 Features in Windows 
Embedded

--- Page 26 ---
SPC-515 Series User Manual 18
3.1 Features in Windows Embedded 
SPC  products  support  the  embedded  Windows  platform.  This  section  outlines  the
important features (EWF and HORM), that are provided in Windows XP embedded. 
3.2 EWF 
EWF stands for Enhanced Write Filter. It provides an upper filter in the storage device
driver stack that redirects disk write operations to volatile (RAM) or non-volatile (disk)
storage. EWF protects a volume from write access. The benefits are as the following.
Write-protect one or more partitions on your system. 
Enable read-only media, such as CD-ROM or flash, to boot and run.
Prolong the lifespan of write-sensitive storage, such as CompactFlash.
SPC-218/221 XPE provides EWF RAM-REG mode on system partition. All writes to
the system partition will be redirected to RAM once this mode is enabled. This mode
is manually enabled by customers after they finish all their changes on the system
such as installing their applications or adjusting system settings.
Advantech provides a pair of utilities to operate EWF, OSLock and OSUnLock. Refer
to the training slide in the folder: “Advantech XPe Add-one.pdf”. 
3.3 HORM
HORM stands for Hibernate  Once  Resume Many. In  HORM environment, a  single
hibernation file is used to boot the system repeatedly. To set a HORM environment,
please follow the steps below.
Make sure EWF is disabled. You can run OSUnLock to disable EWF.
Enable hibernation support:
Run “power options” in control panel, and then select “Enable Hibernation” in hiber-
nation pane. 
Enable EWF:
Run OSLock, and then system reboot automatically.
Open those software that customers want to directly use after system resume from
hibernation.
Hibernate via Advantech HORM utility: 
Click Start Menu->All Programs->Advantech->AdvWF
HORM environment remains all along unless the following events occur:
Run EWF commit command (ewfmgr c: -commit) and then reboot system.
Select “Discard hibernation file” by clicking F8 when system is starting up.
