Safety Precaution - Static Electricity
Follow the simple precautions below to protect yourself from harm and the products
from damage.
 To avoid electrical shock, always disconnect the power from the PC chassis 
before manual handling. Do not touch any components on the CPU card or 
other cards while the equipment is powered on.
 Disconnect the power before executing any configuration changes. A sudden 
rush of power after connecting a jumper or installing a card may damage sensi-
tive electronic components.
Battery Information

rect type. Replace only with the same or equivalent type recommended 
by the manufacturer. Dispose of used batteries according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Par exemple, “Si la batterie est remplacée par un modèle inapproprié, il
y a un risque d’explosion. Remplacer les produits identiques ou équiva-
lents recommandés par le fabricant. Traitement des piles usagées selon
les instructions du fabricant.”

C.1 Watchdog Program Example
The watchdog timer is provided to ensure that standalone systems can always
recover from catastrophic CPU failures and crashes. Such events may have been
caused by external EMI or a software bug. If the CPU is malfunctioning, the watch-
dog timer performs a hardware reset to return the system to a previous state.
The following watchdog timer example code is written in Intel 8086 assembly lan-
guage for a DOS environment. The number of watchdog timer intervals can be set as
0 ~ 255 via software.
