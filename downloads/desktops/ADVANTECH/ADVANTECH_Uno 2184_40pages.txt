Product Warranty (2 years)
Advantech warrants to you, the original purchaser, that each of its products will be
free from defects in materials and workmanship for two years from the date of pur-
chase. 
This warranty does not apply to any products which have been repaired or altered by
persons other than repair personnel authorized by Advantech, or which have been
subject to misuse, abuse, accident or improper installation. Advantech assumes no
liability under the terms of this warranty as a consequence of such events.
Because of Advantech’s high quality-control standards and rigorous testing, most of
our customers never need to use our repair service. If an Advantech product is defec-
tive, it will be repaired or replaced at no charge during the warranty period. For out-
of-warranty repairs, you will be billed according to the cost of replacement materials,
service time and freight. Please consult your dealer for more details.
If you think you have a defective product, follow these steps:
1. Collect all the information about the problem encountered. (For example, CPU 
speed, Advantech products used, other hardware and software used, etc.) Note 
anything abnormal and list any onscreen messages you get when the problem 
occurs.
2. Call your dealer and describe the problem. Please have your manual, product, 
and any helpful information readily available.
3. If your product is diagnosed as defective, obtain an RMA (return merchandize 
authorization) number from your dealer. This allows us to process your return 
more quickly.
4. Carefully pack the defective product, a fully-completed Repair and Replacement 
Order Card and a photocopy proof of purchase date (such as your sales receipt) 
in a shippable container. A product returned without proof of the purchase date 
is not eligible for warranty service.
5. Write the RMA number visibly on the outside of the package and ship it prepaid 
to your dealer.

Safety Precaution - Static Electricity
Follow these simple precautions to protect yourself from harm and the products from
damage.
 To avoid electrical shock, always disconnect the power from your PC chassis 
before you work on it. Don't touch any components on the CPU card or other 
cards while the PC is on.
 Disconnect power before making any configuration changes. The sudden rush 
of power as you connect a jumper or install a card may damage sensitive elec-
tronic components.

1.6 Accessories 
Please refer below for the accessory list: 
 3-pin connector for power wiring (Advantech P/N: 1652003206) 
 SATA signal cable (Advantech P/N: 1700013095) 
 SATA power cable (Advantech P/N: 1700006492) 
 2 PCS jumper (Advantech P/N: 1653302122) 
 Keyboard/Mouse Y cable (Advantech P/N: 1700060202) 
 Driver DVD 
 Warranty card 
If anything is missing or damaged, contact your distributor or sales representative
immediately. 
Warning! Always disconnect the power cord from your chassis whenever you are 
working on it. Do not connect while the power is on. A sudden rush of 
power can damage sensitive electronic components. Only experienced 
electronics personnel should open the chassis. 
Caution! Always ground yourself to remove any static electric charge before 
touching UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL. Modern electronic devices are 
very sensitive to static electric charges. Use a grounding wrist strap at 
all times. Place all electronic components on a static-dissipative surface 
or in a static-shielded bag.

2.2 UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL Interface 
(COM1~COM4) 
UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL offers two standard RS-232/422/485 and two RS-232
(with cable) serial communication inter-face ports: COM1 ~ COM4. 
The IRQ and I/O address range of COM1 to COM4 are listed below: 
COM1: 3F8h, IRQ4 
COM2: 2F8h, IRQ3 
COM3: 3E8h, IRQ10 
COM4: 2E8h, IRQ10

2.2.1 RS-232/422/485 Interface (COM 1 ~ 2) 
The UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL offers two RS-232/422/485 serial communication
interface ports: COM1 and COM2. Please refer to Appendix A.4 for their pin assign-
ments. The default setting of COM1 and COM2 are RS-422/485. 
2.2.2 16C550 UARTs with 128-byte standard 
Advantech UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL comes with OXuPCI952 UARTs containing
128 bytes FIFOs. These upgraded FIFOs greatly reduce CPU overhead and are an
ideal choice for heavy multitasking environments. 
2.2.3 RS-422/485 detection 
In RS-422/485 mode, UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL automatically detects signals to
match RS-422 or RS-485 networks. (No jumper change required) 
2.2.4 Automatic Data Flow Control Function for RS-485 
In RS-485 mode, UNO-2184G/2174G/2174GL automatically detects the direction of
incoming data and switches its transmission direction accordingly. So no handshak-
ing signal (e.g. RTS signal) is necessary. This lets you conveniently build an RS-485
network with just two wires. More importantly, application software previously written
for half duplex RS-232 environments can be maintained without modification. 
2.3 RS-232/422/485 Selection 
COM1 and COM2 support 9-wire RS-232/422/485 interface. The system detects RS-
422 or RS-485 automatically for COM1 and COM2.
You can set the “Auto Flow Control” mode of RS-485 or “Master/Slave” mode of RS-
422 by using the external switch for COM1 and COM2.
Note! In S1 mode, COM 1, 2 data re-transmission will not function properly 
and may include error signals after wake up.
