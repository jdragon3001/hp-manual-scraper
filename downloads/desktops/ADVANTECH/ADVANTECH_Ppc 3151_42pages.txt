Safety Precaution - Static Electricity
Follow these simple precautions to protect yourself from harm and the products from
damage.
 To avoid electrical shock, always disconnect the power from your PC chassis 
before you work on it. Don't touch any components on the CPU card or other 
cards while the PC is on.
 Disconnect power before making any configuration changes. The sudden rush 
of power as you connect a jumper or install a card may damage sensitive elec-
tronic components.
Battery Information
Batteries, battery packs and accumulators should not be disposed of as unsorted
household waste. Please use the public collection system to return, recycle, or treat
them in compliance with the local regulations.
