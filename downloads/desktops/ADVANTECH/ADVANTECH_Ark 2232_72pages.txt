Product Warranty (2 years)
Advantech warrants to you, the original purchaser, that each of its products will be
free from defects in materials and workmanship for two years from the date of pur-
chase. 
This warranty does not apply to any products which have been repaired or altered by
persons other than repair personnel authorized by Advantech, or which have been
subject to misuse, abuse, accident or improper installation. Advantech assumes no
liability under the terms of this warranty as a consequence of such events.
Because of Advantech’s high quality-control standards and rigorous testing, most of
our customers never need to use our repair service. If an Advantech product is defec-
tive, it will be repaired or replaced at no charge during the warranty period. For out-
of-warranty repairs, you will be billed according to the cost of replacement materials,
service time and freight. Please consult your dealer for more details.
If you think you have a defective product, follow these steps:
1. Collect all the information about the problem encountered. (For example, CPU 
speed, Advantech products used, other hardware and software used, etc.) Note 
anything abnormal and list any onscreen messages you get when the problem 
occurs.
2. Call your dealer and describe the problem. Please have your manual, product, 
and any helpful information readily available.
3. If your product is diagnosed as defective, obtain an RMA (return merchandise 
authorization) number from your dealer. This allows us to process your return 
more quickly.
4. Carefully pack the defective product, a fully-completed Repair and Replacement 
Order Card and a photocopy proof of purchase date (such as your sales receipt) 
in a shippable container. A product returned without proof of the purchase date 
is not eligible for warranty service.
5. Write the RMA number visibly on the outside of the package and ship it prepaid 
to your dealer.

ARK-2232 User Manual 2
1.1 Introduction
ARK-2232 is an intelligent, modular and fanless embedded system. A fully modular
design, ARK-2232 supports easy I/O switching with optional iDoor modules, wide
range power board and ARK Plus expansions. ARK-2232 is targeted at factory auto-
mation, machine automation, kiosks, and self-service applications.
Rugged & Multifunctional Design
ARK-2232 embedded box PC is powered by Intel® Atom™ E3940 processor to offer
high performance in low power consumption. The compact size system provides a
selection of I/O ports: 2 x USB 3.0, 4 x USB 2.0, 2 x GbE, 4 x COM, 1 x mPCIe,1
xM.2 E Key and 1 x 2.5" HDD. The default power input is 12V DC in, and it also sup-
ports an optional wide range 9~36V power module with wide temperature operation
of -20 to 60C. ARK-2232 passes worldwide certification including CE/FCC, CB, UL,
CCC and BSMI.
 
Multiple Display Support
ARK-2232 supports dual independents displays: 1 x VGA + 1 x HDMI which HDMI
support 4K resolution. The graphic engine is DirectX 11.3, OpenGL 4.4, and OpenCL
2.1 Full AVC/VC1/MPEG2 HW Decode. 
Built in Intelligent Management Tools - WISE-PaaS
Advantech WISE-PaaS provides a valuable suite of programmable APIs such as
multi-level watchdog, hardware monitor, system restore, and other user-friendly inter-
face. iManager is an intelligent self-management cross platform tool that monitors
system status for problems and takes action if anything is abnormal. It offers a boot
up guarantee in critical, low temperature environments so systems can automatically
recover when voltages dip. WISE-PaaS makes the whole system more reliable and
more intelligent. ARK-2232L provides easy remote management so users can moni-
tor, configure, and control a large number of terminals to make maintenance and sys-
tem recovery simpler.

2.1 Introduction
The following sections show the internal jumpers setting and the external connectors
pin assignment for application.
2.2 Jumpers 
2.2.1 Jumper Description
You may configure ARK-2232 to match the needs of your application by setting jump-
ers. A jumper is a metal bridge used to close an electric circuit. It consists of two
metal pins and a small metal clip (often protected by a plastic cover) that slides over
the pins to connect them. To close a jumper, you connect the pins with the clip. To
open a jumper, you remove the clip. Sometimes a jumper will have three pins,
labeled 1, 2 and 3. In this case you would connect either pins 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
The jumper settings are schematically depicted in this manual as follows.
A pair of needle-nose pliers may be helpful when working with jumpers. If you have
any doubts about the best hardware configuration for your application, contact your
local distributor or sales representative before you make any changes. Generally, you
simply need a standard cable to make most connections.

With the AMIBIOS Setup program, you can modify BIOS settings and control the var-
ious system features. This chapter describes the basic navigation of ARK-2232 BIOS
setup screens.
AMI BIOS ROM has a built-in Setup program that allows users to modify the basic
system configuration. This information is stored in battery-backed CMOS so it retains
the Setup information when the power is turned off.
3.1 Entering Setup
Turn on the computer and check for the patch code. If there is a number assigned to
the patch code, it means that the BIOS supports your CPU. If there is no number
assigned to the patch code, please contact an Advantech application engineer to
obtain an up-to-date patch code file. This will ensure that your CPU's system status is
valid. After ensuring that you have a number assigned to the patch code, press
<DEL> and you will immediately be allowed to enter Setup.
3.1.1 Main Setup 
When you first enter the BIOS Setup Utility, you will encounter the Main setup screen.
You can always return to the Main setup screen by selecting the Main tab. There are
two Main Setup options. They are described in this section. The Main BIOS Setup
screen is shown below.

--- Page 39 ---
29 ARK-2232 User Manual
Chapter 3 AMI BIOS Setup
The Main BIOS setup screen has two main frames. The left frame displays all the
options that can be configured. Grayed-out options cannot be configured; options in
blue can. The right frame displays the key legend.
Above the key legend is an area reserved for a text message. When an option is
selected in the left frame, it is highlighted in white. Often a text message will accom-
pany it.
 System time / System date 
Use this option to change the system time and date. Highlight System Time or
        System Date using the <Arrow> keys. Enter new values through the keyboard.
        Press the <Tab> key or the <Arrow> keys to move between fields. The date
        must be entered in MM/DD/YY format. The time must be entered in HH:MM:SS
        format.
3.1.2 Advanced BIOS Features Setup 
Select the Advanced tab from the ARK-2232 setup screen to enter the Advanced
BIOS Setup screen. You can select any of the items in the left frame of the screen,
such as CPU Configuration, to go to the sub menu for that item. You can display an
Advanced BIOS Setup option by highlighting it using the <Arrow> keys. All Advanced
BIOS Setup options are described in this section. The Advanced BIOS Setup
screens is shown below. The sub menus are described on the following pages.
