Product Warranty (2 years)
Advantech warrants to you, the original purchaser, that each of its products will be
free from defects in materials and workmanship for two years from the date of pur-
chase. 
This warranty does not apply to any products which have been repaired or altered by
persons other than repair personnel authorized by Advantech, or which have been
subject to misuse, abuse, accident or improper installation. Advantech assumes no
liability under the terms of this warranty as a consequence of such events.
Because of Advantech’s high quality-control standards and rigorous testing, most of
our customers never need to use our repair service. If an Advantech product is defec-
tive, it will be repaired or replaced at no charge during the warranty period. For out-
of-warranty repairs, you will be billed according to the cost of replacement materials,
service time and freight. Please consult your dealer for more details.
If you think you have a defective product, follow these steps:
1. Collect all the information about the problem encountered. (For example, CPU 
speed, Advantech products used, other hardware and software used, etc.) Note 
anything abnormal and list any onscreen messages you get when the problem 
occurs.
2. Call your dealer and describe the problem. Please have your manual, product, 
and any helpful information readily available.
3. If your product is diagnosed as defective, obtain an RMA (return merchandise 
authorization) number from your dealer. This allows us to process your return 
more quickly.
4. Carefully pack the defective product, a fully-completed Repair and Replacement 
Order Card and a photocopy proof of purchase date (such as your sales receipt) 
in a shippable container. A product returned without proof of the purchase date 
is not eligible for warranty service.
5. Write the RMA number visibly on the outside of the package and ship it prepaid 
to your dealer.

ARK-1122 User Manual 2
1.1 Introduction
The ARK-1122 fanless Embedded Box Computer is an ideal, application-ready sys-
tem platform solution. All electronics are protected in a compact, sealed, aluminum
case for easy embedding in the customer’s own housing, or as a stand-alone appli-
cation where space is limited and the environment harsh.
The solid, sealed aluminum case offers vibration and dust resistance while also pro-
viding a passive cooling solution. The ARK-1122 provides system integrators with a
turn-key solution and versatile application development path without breaking the
bank or missing time-to-market deadlines.
ARK-1122 is designed as a palm-size fanless embedded system and occupies only
133.8 x 43.1 x 94.2 mm (5.27" x 1.70" x 3.71"). The rugged, cast aluminum case not
only provides great protection from EMI, shock/vibration, cold and heat, but also pas-
sive cooling for quiet, fanless operation. ARK-1122 meets demands by offering up to
1 x VGA, 1 x HDMI, 2 x Giga LAN, 4 x USB 2.0 ports, and 4 x COM ports (by SKU);
all packed into a compact rugged unit and powered by an Intel® Atom™ N2600/
N2800 processor. ARK-1122 also supports both 2.5” SATA HDD, mSATA and SSD
for storage options (by SKU) even though it is a palm-size system. Besides, ARK-
1122 is a low-power-consumption system and it is powered by DC 12 V input. The
ARK-1122 provides for diversified application fields.

2.2.1 Jumper list
2.2.2 Jumper Settings
* Default setting
2.2.3 Jumper Description
Cards can be configured by setting jumpers. A jumper is a metal bridge used to close
an electric circuit. It consists of two metal pins and a small metal clip (often protected
by a plastic cover) that slides over the pins to connect them. To close a jumper, you
connect the pins with the clip. To open a jumper, you remove the clip. Sometimes a
jumper will have three pins, labeled 1, 2 and 3. In this case you would connect either
pins 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
The jumper settings are schematically depicted in this manual as follows.
A pair of needle-nose pliers may be helpful when working with jumpers. If you have
any doubts about the best hardware configuration for your application, contact your
local distributor or sales representative before you make any changes.

AMIBIOS has been integrated into a plethora of motherboards for a couple decades.
With the AMIBIOS Setup program, users can modify BIOS settings and control vari-
ous system features. This chapter describes the basic navigation of the ARK-1122
BIOS setup screens. 
 
Figure 3.1 Setup program initial screen
AMI's BIOS ROM has a built-in Setup program that allows users to modify the basic
system configuration. This information is stored in flash ROM so it retains the Setup
information when the power is turned off.
