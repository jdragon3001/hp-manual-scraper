This warranty does not apply to any products which have been repaired or altered by
persons other than repair personnel authorized by Advantech, or which have been
subject to misuse, abuse, accident or improper installation. Advantech assumes no
liability under the terms of this warranty as a consequence of such events.
Because of Advantech’s high quality-control standards and rigorous testing, most of
our customers never need to use our repair service. If an Advantech product is defec-
tive, it will be repaired or replaced at no charge during the warranty period. For out-
of-warranty repairs, you will be billed according to the cost of replacement materials,
service time and freight. Please consult your dealer for more details.
If you think you have a defective product, follow these steps:
1. Collect all the information about the problem encountered. (For example, CPU 
speed, Advantech products used, other hardware and software used, etc.) Note 
anything abnormal and list any onscreen messages you get when the problem 
occurs.
2. Call your dealer and describe the problem. Please have your manual, product, 
and any helpful information readily available.
3. If your product is diagnosed as defective, obtain an RMA (return merchandise 
authorization) number from your dealer. This allows us to process your return 
more quickly.
4. Carefully pack the defective product, a fully-completed Repair and Replacement 
Order Card and a photocopy proof of purchase date (such as your sales receipt) 
in a shippable container. A product returned without proof of the purchase date 
is not eligible for warranty service.

ARK-3510 User Manual 2
1.1 Introduction
ARK-3510 is an intelligent, fanless embedded system powered by Intel 3rd Gen.
Core i rPGA high performance processor with multiple I/O interface and 2 removable
2.5" HDD drive bays.
ARK-3510 offers 1 x DVI-I, 1 x DisplayPort, 1 x HDMI interface which can support
independent Tri-display, 4 x USB 3.0 ports, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, 2 x Giga LAN ports,
audio function, 4 x COM ports, 2 x Mini PCI sockets with SIM holders; all packed into
a rugged unit and powered by an Intel® 3rd generation rPGA Core™ i7/i5/i3 proces-
sor (supporting up to 45W). The ARK-3510 IPC supports 2 x 2.5” removable SATA
HDD driver bays, 1 x CFast card, and 2 x mSATA (miniPCIe slots, switch by BIOS)
for storage options.
Multi-functional Design
ARK-3510 offers 1 x DVI-I, 1 x DisplayPort, 1 x HDMI interface which can support
independent Tri-display, 4 x USB 3.0 ports, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, 2 x GigaLAN ports,
Audio function, 4 x COM ports, and 2 x Mini PCI sockets with SIM holders; all packed
into a rugged unit and powered by an Intel® 3 generation rPGA Core™ i7/i5/i3 pro-
cessor (supporting up to 45W). The ARK-3510 IPC supports 2 x 2.5” removable
SATA HDD driver bays, and 1 x CFast card, and 2 x mSATA (miniPCIe slots, switch
by BIOS) for storage options.
 
Flexible Design
ARK-3510 is a rugged high performance fanless embedded box PC which can sup-
port wide-temperature ranges from -10~60C (with SSD), it supports 12 VDC for the
standard model, but we reserve a wide-input power module as an optional item which
can support a wider range of power from 9-34VDC. We also reserve a special design
for easily customized I/O support, ARK-3510 can use any standard MIOe-2XX series
modules as an option for additional and flexible I/O port support. ARK-3510 is a flexi-
ble model which can work in different environments and applications with multiple I/O
and high performance support.
Built in Intelligent Management Tools - Advantech iManager & SUSIAccess
Advantech iManager provides a valuable suite of programmable APIs such as multi-
level watchdog, hardware monitor, system restore, and other user-friendly interface.
iManager is an intelligent self-management cross platform tool that monitors system
status for problems and takes action if anything is abnormal. iManager offers a boot
up guarantee in critical, low temperature environments so systems can automatically
recover when voltages dip. iManager makes the whole system more reliable and
more intelligent. ARK-3510 also supports Advantech’s own SUSIAccess, which pro-
vides easy remote management so users can monitor, configure, and control a large
number of terminals to make maintenance and system recovery simpler.

2.1 Introduction
The following sections show the internal jumpers setting and the external connectors
pin assignment for application.
2.2 Jumpers 
2.2.1 Jumper Description
You may configure ARK-3510 to match the needs of your application by setting jump-
ers. A jumper is a metal bridge used to close an electric circuit. It consists of two
metal pins and a small metal clip (often protected by a plastic cover) that slides over
the pins to connect them. To close a jumper, you connect the pins with the clip. To
open a jumper, you remove the clip. Sometimes a jumper will have three pins,
labeled 1, 2 and 3. In this case you would connect either pins 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
The jumper settings are schematically depicted in this manual as follows.
A pair of needle-nose pliers may be helpful when working with jumpers. If you have
any doubts about the best hardware configuration for your application, contact your
local distributor or sales representative before you make any changes. Generally, you
simply need a standard cable to make most connections.

Always use the grease pad provided by Advantech. The P/N of the grease pad is: 
To ensure the best thermal performance, it is recommended to replace the thermal
grease for CPU thermal pole each time the top cover is opened.
1. To replace the thermal grease, clean up the CPU thermal pole by using paper 
tissue or soft cloth. DO NOT USE any kind of solvent to clean the thermal pole 
as this may damage the thermal grease inside the thermal pole.
2. Gently remove one of the protective papers on the grease pad and apply the 
grease to the CPU thermal pole. Press onto the grease pad for 30 seconds, 
then remove the protective paper gently from the grease pad.

AMIBIOS has been integrated into many motherboards for over a decade. With the
AMIBIOS Setup program, users can modify BIOS settings and control various sys-
tem features. This chapter describes the basic navigation of the ARK-3510 BIOS
setup screens. 
Figure 3.1 Setup program initial screen
AMI's BIOS ROM has a built-in Setup program that allows users to modify the basic
system configuration. This information is stored in flash ROM so it retains the Setup
information when the power is turned off.
3.1 Entering Setup 
Turn on the computer and then press <F2> or <DEL> to enter Setup menu.
3.2 Main Setup 
When users first enter the BIOS Setup Utility, users will enter the Main setup screen.
Users can always return to the Main setup screen by selecting the Main tab. There
are two Main Setup options. They are described in this section. The Main BIOS
Setup screen is shown below.

The Main BIOS setup screen has two main frames. The left frame displays all the
options that can be configured. Grayed-out options cannot be configured; options in
blue can. The right frame displays the key legend. 
Above the key legend is an area reserved for a text message. When an option is
selected in the left frame, it is highlighted in white. Often a text message will accom-
pany it.
3.2.1 System time / System date 
Use this option to change the system time and date. Highlight System Time or Sys-
tem Date using the <Arrow> keys. Enter new values through the keyboard. Press the
<Tab> key or the <Arrow> keys to move between fields. The date must be entered in
MM/DD/YY format. The time must be entered in HH:MM:SS format.
3.3 Advanced BIOS Features Setup 
Select the Advanced tab from the ARK-3510 setup screen to enter the Advanced
BIOS Setup screen. Users can select any item in the left frame of the screen, such as
CPU Configuration, to go to the sub menu for that item. Users can display an
