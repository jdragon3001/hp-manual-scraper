Chapter 2 System Setup
2.3 Running the BIOS Setup Program
Your POC-W152/W152C was probably set up and configured by your dealer prior to
delivery. You may still find it necessary to use the BIOS (Basic Input-Output System)
setup program to change system configuration information, such as the current date
and time or your type of hard drive. The setup program is stored in read-only mem-
ory. It can be accessed either when you turn on or reset the panel PC, by pressing
the “F2 or Del” key on your keyboard immediately after powering on the computer.
The settings you specify with the setup program are recorded in a special area of
memory called CMOS RAM. This memory is backed up by a battery so that it will not
be erased when you turn off or reset the system. Whenever you turn on the power,
the system reads the settings stored in CMOS RAM and compares them to the
equipment check conducted during the power on self-test (POST). If an error occurs,
an error message will be displayed on screen, and you will be prompted to run the
setup program.
2.4 Installing System Software
Recent releases of operating systems from major vendors include setup programs
which load automatically and guide you through hard disk preparation and operating
system installation. The guidelines below will help you determine the steps necessary
to install your operating system on the panel PC hard drive.
If required, insert your operating system's installation or setup diskette into the exter-
nal diskette drive until the release button pops out.
The BIOS supports system boots up directly from the CD-ROM drive. You may also
insert your system installation CD-ROM disk into your external CD-ROM drive.
Power on or reset the system by pressing the “F2 or Del” key to boot into BIOS menu
and adjust the boot device sequence.
You can also press F12 key when booting; a bootable device popup menu will
appear, you can select bootable device that you want. The Point-of-Care Terminal will
automatically load the operating system from the diskette or CD-ROM.
If you are presented with the opening screen of a setup or installation program, follow
the instructions on screen. The setup program will guide you through preparation of
your hard drive, and installation of the operating system.
Note! Some distributors and system integrators may have already pre-
installed system software prior to shipment of your panel PC.

2.5 Installing the Drivers
After installing your system software, you will be able to set up the Chipset, Graphics,
Ethernet, Audio, and Touchscreen functions from your own external CD-ROM drive.
All the drivers except the CD-ROM drive driver are stored in a CD-ROM disc entitled
"Drivers and Utilities."
The standard automatic installation procedures for installing the Chipset, Graphics,
Audio, Ethernet, TXE and Touch drivers are described in Chapter 3.
The various drivers and utilities in the CD-ROM disc have their own text files which
help users install the drivers and understand their functions. These files are a very
useful supplement to the information in this manual.
Troubleshooting

NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range applies.
NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is 
affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people.
a
 Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) 
telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV 
broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic 
environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be consid-
ered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the POC-W212C is used exceeds 
the applicable RF compliance level above, the POC-W212C should be observed to verify 
normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be neces-
sary, such as reorienting or relocating the unit.
b
 Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m.

3.1 General Safety Guide
For your own safety and that of your equipment, always take the following precau-
tions.
Disconnect the power plug (by pulling the plug, not the cord), from your computer if
any of the following conditions exists:
 The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged 
 You spill something into the case 
 Your computer has been dropped or the case has been otherwise damaged 
 You suspect that your computer needs service or repair 
 You want to clean the computer or screen
 You want to remove/install any parts
3.2 Protecting Your Optical Drive 
To keep your optical drive working properly:
 Position your computer so that the drive tray doesn't bump into anything when it 
opens. 
 Close the drive when you're not using it. 
 Do not put anything on the drive tray when it is open. 
 Do not touch the optical drive lens with your fingers. Do not wipe the lens with a 
paper towel or other abrasive surface. 
3.3 Thermal
The vent hole of the POC-W152/W152C rear cover functions as a cooling air flow
inlet and outlet. These air inlets and outlets transfer heat from inside the computer to
the cooler air outside. Do not block these holes/vents with any soft material.
When using your POC-W152/W152C system, it is normal for the rear metal heatsink
to get warm. The rear metal heatsink of the POC-W152/W152C functions as a cool-
ing surface that transfers heat from inside the computer to the cooler air outside. Do
not block this heatsink with any soft material.
Warning! Do not place your POC-W152/W152C system on a pillow or other soft 
material when it is on, as the material may block the airflow and cause 
the computer to overheat.

Chapter 3 Operation and Safety Information
3.4 Disconnect the Power
The only way to disconnect power completely is to unplug the adapter power cord.
Make sure at least one end of the power cord is within easy reach so that you can
unplug the computer when you need to.
Warning! Your AC cord came equipped with a three-wire grounding plug (a plug 
that has a third grounding pin). This plug will fit only a grounded AC out-
let. If you are unable to insert the plug into an outlet because the outlet is 
not grounded, contact a licensed electrician to replace the outlet with a 
properly grounded outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding 
plug.
Warning! Never push objects of any kind into this product through the openings in 
the case. Doing so may be dangerous and result in fire or a dangerous 
electric shock.
Never place anything on system case before turning off the computer.
Never turn on your computer unless all of its internal and external parts 
are in place.
Operating the computer when it is open or missing parts can be danger-
ous and can damage the system.

A.1 Install VESA Mounting
The POC-W152/W152C also provides standard VESA mounting to help system inte-
grators conveniently integrate the panel PC into their system.
Never use mounting brackets except as provided by Advantech to prevent unreliable
mounting of the POC-W152/W152C. VESA mount installation should be carried out
by a professional technician; please contact a service technician or your retailer if you
need this service.
Installation instructions follow:
1. First attach wall-mounting to the heat-sink of the POC-W152/W152C, securing it 
in place with the four Phillips-head screws provided.
2. Mount the unit on the wall, stand or other flat surface.
