Dell Wyse P20  
and No Click Access
Fast, secure access that’s always on,  
always with you
The Dell Wyse P20 zero client and VMware View VDI 
software are transforming how medical sta, securities 
traders and government ocials access critical data in 
real-time with virtual desktop solutions that deliver security, 
simplicity and convenience at much lower cost than PCs. 
Now with Imprivata’s OneSign Virtual Desktop Access™, 
the Dell Wyse P20 zero client provides secure access to 
roaming virtual desktops within seconds for each log-in. 
Using proximity authentication, users can securely access 
their virtual desktops within seconds by tapping an ID badge 
against a smart authentication reader connected to the  
Dell Wyse P20. The desktop appears in the exact same state 
as when the user last used it, wherever they used it. No 
Click Access eliminates the need to memorize and enter 
multiple passwords and credentials while signing onto 
virtual desktops, saving valuable – often critical – time.
Simple. Fast. Secure.
As the industry’s premier zero client for VMware View, the 
P20 oers incredible ease-of-use, security, performance 
and ﬂexibility in any roaming desktop application. And with 
no CPU, application OS, device drivers, fan or hard drive 
the P20 is easy to centrally manage and maintain, uses 
roughly 90% less energy than a PC, and lasts longer. As a 
result, the solution dramatically improves eciencies, now 
and in years to come.
Simple, fast, secure sign-on for demanding 
environments 
Healthcare
Dell Wyse zero clients facilitate electronic record-keeping 
in support of strict compliance mandates and ensure 
faster, more reliable access to critical information and 
life-impacting applications. With Imprivata OneSign Virtual 
Desktop Access, clinicians tap a proximity card to an 
authentication reader connected to the Dell Wyse P20.  
Within seconds, a personalized desktop session  
resumes – no sign-in needed.
Securities trading
Every second counts when stock is rising or falling, and  
a delay could mean the loss of hundreds or thousands 
of dollars – or more. With the Dell Wyse P20 and a 
connected proximity card reader, a broker can instantly  
log on to a P20-powered kiosk on the trading ﬂoor or  
zero client in his or her oce to make the trade without 
wasting time entering credentials.
Government facilities 
In high-security environments where access control is 
strictly monitored, often with second-order authentication, 
the P20 with a connected proximity card reader enables 
rapid user authentication, ensuring only authorized access 
to sensitive information. Remote management enables 
centralized administration and control, and the ability 
to carefully track and report on access and activity for 
regulatory purposes.
