Hybrid graphics
Your notebook is equipped with a hybrid graphics system. By clicking the Quick Start
button, you can switch between battery-saver and performance mode.
Use the graphics unit integrated in the chip set for ap plications which are
less graphics-intensive, such as video playback, e-mail and Internet surﬁng.
This reduces heat generation, n oise levels and power consumption. As a
result, battery life is increased (battery saver mode).
If you require a high level of performance, for example, for games, you can
switch to the ext ernal graphics unit (performance mode).
Change graphics mode
In your notebook, the external graphics mode is preconﬁgured ex works (performance mode).
A device connected to an HDMI port of your notebook (FullHD resolution) can only be
activated in performance mode via the external graphics unit.

Second hard drive in RAID group
RedundantAr rayofIndepe ndentDisksRAID
Removal and installation of the second hard disk must only be p erformed by
authorised service agents of Fujitsu Siemens Computers GmbH. Unauthorised
removal and installation will invalidate your warranty.
For further information and addresses of our service partners, please
see "http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/support".
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, also: Disk Array) is a procedure for
combining two hard disks to create a logical unit.
A so-called disk array can be used advan tageously to improve performance or
alternatively to improve error tolerance (data protection).
Error tolerance is facilitated by means of data redundancy. If one drive malfunctions,
a different drive con tains an exact copy of the data. This can prevent an operating
system from malfunctioning or data from being lost.
The o perating system detects all hard disks in a disk array as a single physical
hard disk. The individual disk drive s in a disk array are called "members". Member
conﬁguration information is recorded in the reserved sector of the hard disk. With this
information the ha rd disk can be identiﬁed as a member.
There are usually a few methods by which hard disks can be combined. These methods
are referred to as different RAID levels. The different RAID levels represent different
performance and security levels as well as implementation costs.
Depending on the size of the hard disk, the process for combining two
hard drives to create a RAID group can take several hours. During this
time period, your screen will turn b lack.
For further information regarding the conﬁguration of y our RAID systems, please

Preparing your notebook for use
Preparing your notebook for use
First-timesetupNotebookGettingstartedNotebook
If your notebook comes with a Windows operating system then all of the necessary
hardware drivers and the supplied software will already be pre-installed.
With the operating system Microsoft Vista, it may take up to 20 minutes to prepare your
notebook for use depending on the hardware ﬁtted and the software supplied.
When you switch on the notebook for the ﬁrst time it will perform a system
check. A numbe r of different messages may be displayed. In the pro cess,
the display may ﬂicker or darken temporarily.
Please follow the instructions on the screen.
It is very important that you do not switch the notebook off during this initial set-up process.
Before you can use your notebook for the ﬁrst time you will need to charge the battery.
On delivery, th e battery can be found in the battery compartment or in the accessories kit. The
battery must be charged if you want to operate your notebook with the battery.
When not plugged into a mains socket, the notebook runs on its built-in battery. You can
increase the battery’s life by enabling the system’s energy saving functions.
If you use the notebook in at home or in an ofﬁce, we recommend you use
the m ains adapter instead of the battery.
Please refer to the "AMILO Notebook" operating manual for i nstructions on how to connect
external devices (e.g. a mouse or a printer) to the notebook.

Der Aus- und Einbau der zweiten Fe stplatte darf nur von autorisierten Servicepartnern
der Fujitsu Siemens Computers GmbH durchgeführt werden. Durch unbefugten

RAID (R edundant Array of Independent Disks, auch: Disk-Array) ist ein Verfahren zur
Kombination von zwei Festplatten zu einer logischen Einheit.
Ein so genannter Disk-Array lässt sich vorteilhaft zur Verbesserung der Performance oder
alternativ zu Verbesserung der Fehlertoleranz (Datenschutz) einsetzen.
Fehlertoleranz wird mittels Datenredundanz ermöglicht. Bei Ausfall eines Laufw erks
enthält ein anderes Laufwerk eine gespiegelte Kopie der Daten. Dadurch können Ausfall
des Betriebssystems oder Datenverlust verhindert werd en.
Das B etriebssystem erkenn t alle Festplatten in einem Disk-Array als eine einzige p hysikalische
Festplatte. Die einze lnen Festplatten in einem Disk-Array werden als " Member" (Mitglieder)
bezeichnet. Angaben zur Konﬁguration eines Members werden im reservierten Sektor der Festplatte
aufgezeichnet. Durch diese Angaben kann die Festplatte als ein Member identiﬁziert werden.
Gewöhnlich lassen sich Festplatten durch verschiedene Verfahren miteinander kombinieren. Diese
Verfahren werde n als unterschiedliche RAID-Level s bezeichnet. Die u nterschied lichen RAID-Levels
verkörpern verschiedene Performance- und Sicherheitsstufen sowie Implementierungskosten.
Abhängig von der Festplattengröße kann die Kombination von zwei
Festplatten zu einem R AID-Verbund me hrere S tunden dauern. Während
dieses Zeitraumes wird Ihr Display schwarz.

Deuxième disque dur en RAID
RedundantAr rayofIndepe ndentDisksRAID
La dépose et la pose du deuxième disque dur ne doivent être effectuées que par
des partenaires service autorisés de Fujitsu S iemens Computers. Tout dé montage
ou montage non autorisé annule le droit à la garantie.
Pour obtenir de plus amples informations et les adresses de nos partenaires service,
consultez notre site internet "http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/support".
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, ou : Disk-Array) est une méthode consistant à
combiner deux o u plusieurs disques durs pour n’en faire qu’une unité logique.
Ce que l’on appelle une pile de disques ou un "disk array" permet d’améliorer
considérablement les performances ou constitue une autre solution pour améliorer
la tolérance aux pannes (protection des données).
La tolérance aux pannes s’obtient grâce à la redonda nce des données. En cas de défaillance
d’un lecteur, elle met à la disposition d’un a u tre lecteur une copie miroir des donné es. On
empêche ainsi les défa illances du système d’exploitation ou les pertes de données.
Le système d’exploitation reconnaît tous les disques durs d’un disk array comme formant un seul
et même disque dur physique. C hacun des disques durs d’un disk array est appelé "Member"
(membre). Les données de conﬁguration d’un membre sont enregistrées dans un secteur réservé
du disque du r. Ces données se rvent à identiﬁer le disque du r comme membre.
Habituellement, les disques durs peuvent être combinés selon différentes méthodes. Ces méthodes
sont désignées comm e autant de n iveaux RAID. Les différents niveaux RAID correspondent à
des niveaux de performances et de sécurité e t à des coûts d’implémentation différents.
En fonction de la taille des disques durs, le regroupement de deu x
disques durs pour former un RAID peut durer plusieurs heures. Pendant
cette période, votre écran restera noir.

RedundantAr rayofIndepe ndentDisksRAID
La instalación y desmontaje del segundo disco duro solo d ebe llevarse a cabo
por un servicio t écnico autorizado de F ujitsu Siemens Computers GmbH. En

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, también: Disk-Array) es un procedimiento
mediante el que se agrupan dos discos duros en una unidad lógica.
Un Disk-Array aporta beneﬁcios en lo que se reﬁere a la mejora del rendimiento o,
alternativamente, la tolerancia a errores (protección de datos).
La tolerancia a errores se logra gracias a la redundancia de los datos. En caso de que
una unidad falle, otra unidad contiene una copia espejo de los da tos. De este modo puede
evitarse una pérdida de datos o la caída del sistema operativo.
El sistema operativo identiﬁca todos los discos duros en un Disk-Array como un único disco duro
físico. Cada uno de los discos duros en un Disk-Array se designa como "Member" (miembro).
En el sector rese rvado del disco duro se graban los datos referidos a la conﬁguración de un
miembro. A través de estos datos, el disco duro puede identiﬁcarse como miembro.
Por lo general, los discos duros se agrupan mediante distintos procedimientos. Estos
procedimientos se designan como diferentes niveles RAID. Los diferentes niveles RAID representan
los distintos niveles de rendimiento y seguridad, así como los costes de implementación.
Dependiendo del tamaño d e los discos duros la combinación de do s
discos duros en una matriz RAID p uede tard ar varias horas. Durante este
periodo de tiempo su pantalla se volverá negra.

Graﬁca ibrida
Il notebook è provvisto di una soluzione a graﬁca ibrida. Tramite i tasti di avvio rapido è possibile
passare dalla modalità di risparm io batteria alla modalità prestazioni e viceversa.
Se si utilizzano applicazioni con graﬁca meno inte nsa, ad esempio durante
la riproduzione di video, o duran te l’utilizzo della email o la navigazione in
Internet, usare l’unità graﬁca integrata nel chipset. In tal modo si riducono la
produzione di calore, il livello di rumorosità e il consumo di carburante. La
durata della batteria aumenta (modalità di risparmio batteria).
Se si necessita di prestazioni più elevate, ad esempio per giochi, è possibile
passare all’unità graﬁca esterna (modalità prestazioni).
Cambio della modalità graﬁca
Sul proprio notebook la modalità gra ﬁca esterna (modalità prestazioni) viene preimpostata in fabbrica.
Un dispositivo sul connettore HDMI del n otebook (risoluzione piena HD) p uò essere
azionato dall’unità graﬁca esterna solo in modalità prestazioni.
► Premere il tasto di avvio rapido

sulla scheda multimediale del notebook:

L’immagine graﬁca cambia in modalità di risparmio batteria.
► Premere nuovamente il tasto di avvio rapido

Secondo disco rigido nel complesso RAID
RedundantAr rayofIndepe ndentDisksRAID
Lo smontaggio e il montaggio del secondo disco rigido può essere eseguito solo
da un centro di assistenza autorizzato da Fujitsu Siemens Computers GmbH. In
caso di montaggio o smontaggio non autorizzato, la garanzia decade.
Ulteriori informazioni e indirizzi de i nostri centri di assistenza sono riperibili su
Internet all’indirizzo " http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/support".
RAID (Redund ant Array of Independent Disks, anche: Disk-Array) è una procedura
per la combinazione di due dischi rigidi in un’unità logica.
Per migliorare le prestazioni o, in alternativa, la tolleranza di erro re (protezione
dati), si può utilizzare un cosiddetto disk arra y.
La tolleranza di errore si realizza tramite la ridondanza dei dati, facendo in modo che in
caso di guasto di un’unità, l’altra unità riceva una copia ‘specchiata’ dei dati. Si evitano
in questo modo un guasto del siste m a operativo o la perdita dei dati.
Il sistema operativo riconosce tutti i dischi rigidi di un disk array come un un unico disco rigido
ﬁsico. In un d isk array i singoli dischi rigidi vengono deﬁniti come "membe r" (membri) . I dati
per la conﬁgurazione di un membro vengono registrati in un settore riservato del disco rigido.
Grazie a questi dati è possibile identiﬁcareildiscorigidocomeunmembro.
Generalmente i d ischi rigidi si possono combinare reciprocamente con diverse procedure.
Queste procedure vengono deﬁnite come diversi RAID level. I diversi RAID level identiﬁcano
diversi livelli di performance e di sicurezza, nonché diversi costi di implementazione.
A seconda delle dimensioni del disco rigido, la combinazione di due dischi
rigidi in un co mplesso RAID può durare d iverse ore. Durante questo
lasso di tempo, lo sche rmo diventa nero.

Hybrid Graphics
Uw Notebook is met Hybrid Graphics uitgerust. Via de sneltoets kunt u navigeren
tussen de accuspaarmodus en de Performance-modus.
Gebruik bij applicaties die graﬁsch minder veeleisend zijn (bijvoorbeeld bij het
afspelen va n video’s, gebruik van e-mail of bij internet surfen) de in de chipset
ingebouwde graﬁsche eenheid. Hierdoor worden warmteontwikkeling, geluidsniveau en
stroomverbruik verminderd. De gebruiksduur van de accu stijgt (accuspaarmodus).
Wanneer u hoge prestaties wenst (bijvoorbeeld voor spelletjes) kan worden
geschakeld naar de e xterne graﬁsche eenh eid (Perform ance-modus).
Wisselen van graﬁsche m odus
Op uw notebook is af fabriek de externe graﬁsche modus (Performance-modus) vooraf ingesteld.

Tweede harde schijf in de RAID-groep
RedundantAr rayofIndepe ndentDisksRAID
De tweede harde schijf mag alleen worden gedemonteerd en gemonteerd door erkende
onderhoudspartners van Fujitsu Siemens Co mputers GmbH. Indien de demontage
en montage door onbevoegden wordt uitgevoerd, dan vervalt de garantie.
U vindt meer informatie en adresse n van onze servicepartners op het Internet
onder "http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/support".
RAID (Red undant Array of Independent Disks, ook wel D isk-Array) is een methode voor
het combineren van twee harde schijven tot een logische eenheid.
Een zogenaamde Disk-Array is uitermate geschikt om te worden gebruikt voor het verbeteren van
de prestaties of als alternatief om de fou ttolerantie (gegevensbescherming) te verbeteren.
Fouttolerantie is mogelijk via gegevensreductie. Bij het uitvallen van een station bevat
een ander station een gespiegelde kopie van de gegeven s. Hierdoor kan uitvallen van
het besturingssysteem of gegevensverlies word en voorkomen.
Het besturingssyste em herkent alle harde schijven in een Disk-Array als één fysische harde
schijf. D e afzonderlijke harde schijven in een Disk-Array worden aangeduid als "Member" (lid).
Conﬁguratiegegevens van een Member worden opgeslagen op een gereserveerde sector van de
harde sch ijf. Aan de hand van deze gegevens kan de harde schijf w orden herkend als M ember.
Normaal gesp roken kunnen harde schijven via verschillende procedures met elkaar
worden gecombineerd. Deze procedures word en als verschillende R AID -niveaus
aangeduid. De verschillende RAID -nive aus belichamen verschillende prestatie-
en veiligheidsfasen en implementatiekosten.
Afhankelijk van de grootte van de harde schijf kan het combineren van
twee harde schijven tot een RAID-groe p enkele uren in beslag nemen.
Tijdens deze periode wordt het display zwart.

Placa gráﬁca Hybrid
O seu Notebook está equipado com uma placa gráﬁca Hybrid. Através da tecla de arra nque rápido
poderá alternar entre o modo de poupança de c arga da bateriaeomodoperformance.
No caso de aplicações que utilizem pouca capacidade da placa gráﬁ ca, por ex.,
reprodução de vídeo, correio electrónico ou navegação na Internet, utilize a unidade
gráﬁca integrada na placa gráﬁca. Isto permitirá gerar menos calor e menos
ruído, assim como diminuir o consumo de corrente. A autonomia da bateria é
também prolongada (modo de poupança da carga da bateria).
Se precisar de uma elevada performance, por ex., para jogos, poderá utilizar
a unidade gráﬁca exterior (modo performance).
Mudar o modo gráﬁco
O Notebook vem pré-conﬁgurado de fábrica com o modo gráﬁco externo (modo performance) activo.
Um aparelho conectado à ligação HDMI do Notebook (resolução FullHD) só pode ser
controlado no modo performance através da un idad e gráﬁca externa.

combinada RAID
RedundantAr rayofIndepe ndentDisksRAID
A desmontagem e a montagem do segundo disco rígido só podem ser
realizadas por um parceiro de assistência técnica autorizado da Fujitsu
Siemens Computers GmbH. A desmontagem e a montage m realizadas por
pessoas não autorizadas anularão a garantia.
Pode encontrar informações adicionais e as moradas dos nossos parceiros de

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, também conhecido como: Disk-Array) é um
processo de combinação de dois discos rígidos num unidade lógica.
O chamado Disk-Array utiliza-se preferencialmente para melhorar a performance ou, em
alternativa, melhorar a tolerância aos erros (protecção dos dados).
A tolerância aos erros é viabilizada através da redundância de dados. No caso de
falha de u ma unidade, a outra unidade contém uma cópia dos dados. Isto impede
a falha do sistema operativo ou a perda de dados.
O sistema operativo reconhece todos os discos rígidos de um Disk-Array como um único disco
rígido físico. Os d isco s rígidos individuais de um Disk-Array são designados de "Memb er"
(membro). As indicações para conﬁguração de um membro estão incluídas no sector reservado
do disco rígido. Estas indicações permitem identiﬁcar o disco rígido como membro.
Normalmente, os discos rígidos podem ser combinados por diversos métodos. Estes méto dos são
designados como diferentes níveis RAID. Os diferentes n íveis RAID incorporam vários níveis de
performance e segurança, implicando também diferentes custos de implementação.
Em função do tamanho do disco ríg ido, pode demorar várias horas a combinar do is
discos rígidos num conjunto RAID. Durante este período o ecrã ﬁca escuro.
