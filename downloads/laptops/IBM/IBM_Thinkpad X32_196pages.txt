Introduction 
Important  service  information 
 
Important 
BIOS  and  device  driver  fixes  are 
customer-installable.  The  BIOS  and  device  drivers 
are  posted  on  the  customer  support  site 
http://www.lenovo.com/think/  support 
Advise  customers  to  contact  the  Customer  Support 
Center  at  800-426-7378  if  they  need  assistance  in 
obtaining  or  installing  any  diskette  fixes. 
Customers  in  Canada  should  call  the  Customer 
Support  Center  at  800-565-3344  for  assistance  or 
download  information. 
Strategy  for  replacing  FRUs 
 
 
Before  replacing  parts 
Make  sure  that  all  diskette  fixes  are  installed  before 
replacing  any  FRUs  listed  in  this  manual.
 Use  the  following  strategy  to  prevent  unnecessary  expense 
for  replacing  and  servicing  FRUs: 
v    If  you  are  instructed  to  replace  a  FRU  but  the 
replacement  does  not  correct  the  problem,  reinstall 
the  original  FRU  before  you  continue. 
v    Some  computers  have  both  a  processor  board  and  a 
system  board.  If  you  are  instructed  to  replace  either  the 
processor  board  or  the  system  board,  and  replacing  one 
of  them  does  not  correct  the  problem,  reinstall  that 
board,  and  then  replace  the  other  one. 
v    If  an  adapter  or  a  device  consists  of  more  than  one 
FRU,  any  of  the  FRUs  may  be  the  cause  of  the  error. 
Before  replacing  the  adapter  or  device,  remove  the 
FRUs,  one  by  one,  to  see  if  the  symptoms  change. 
Replace  only  the  FRU  that  changed  the  symptoms. 
Attention:   The  setup  configuration  on  the  computer  you 
are  servicing  may  have  been  customized.  Running 
Automatic  Configuration  may  alter  the  settings.  Note  the 
current  configuration  settings  (using  the  View  Configuration 
option);  then,  when  service  has  been  completed,  verify  that 
those  settings  remain  in  effect.

Strategy  for  replacing  a  hard  disk  drive 
Always  try  to  run  a  low-level  format  before  replacing  a  hard 
disk  drive. 
 
Attention:   The  drive  startup  sequence  in  the  computer 
you  are  servicing  may  have  been  changed.  Be  extremely 
careful  during  write  operations  such  as  copying,  saving,  or 
formatting.  If  you  select  an  incorrect  drive,  data  or 
programs  can  be  overwritten. 
How  to  use  error  messages 
Use  the  error  codes  displayed  on  the  screen  to  diagnose 
failures.  If  more  than  one  error  code  is  displayed,  begin  the 
diagnosis  with  the  first  error  code.  Whatever  causes  the 
first  error  code  may  also  cause  false  error  codes.  If  no 
error  code  is  displayed,  see  whether  the  error  symptom  is 
listed  in  the  Symptom-to-FRU  Index  for  the  computer  you 
are  servicing. 
Strategy  for  replacing  FRUs  for  CTO, 
CMV,  and  GAV 
Product  definition 
Dynamic  Configure  To  Order  (CTO)
This  provides  the  ability  for  a  customer  to  configure  an 
IBM
®
 
solution  from  an  eSite,  and  have  this  configuration 
sent  to  fulfillment,  where  it  is  built  and  shipped  directly  to 
the  customer.  The  machine  label,  PC  Entitlement 
Warehouse  (PEW),  eSupport,  and  the  HMM  will  load  these 
products  as  the  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  model,  where  model 
=  “CTO”  (Example:  1829-CTO). 
Custom  Model  Variant  (CMV)
This  is  a  unique  configuration  that  has  been  negotiated 
between  IBM  and  the  customer.  A  unique  4-digit  MT  and 
3-digit  model  is  provided  to  the  customer  to  place  orders 
(Example:  1829-W15).  A  CMV  is  a  special  bid  offering. 
Therefore,  it  is  NOT  generally  announced. 
v    The  MTM  portion  of  the  machine  label  is  the  4-digit  MT 
and  3-digit  model,  where  model  =  “CTO”  (Example: 
1829-CTO).  The  PRODUCT  ID  portion  of  the  machine 
label  is  the  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  CMV  model  (Example: 
1829-W15). 
v    The  PEW  record  is  the  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  model, 
where  model  =  “CTO”  (Example:  1829-CTO). 
v    eSupport  will  show  both  the  CTO  and  CMV  machine 
type  models  (Example:  1829-CTO  and  1829-W15  will  be 
found  on  the  eSupport  site.) 
Important  service  information

--- Page 9 ---
v    The  HMM  will  have  the  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  CTO 
model  only  (Example:  1829-CTO).  Again,  CMVs  are 
custom  models  and  are  not  found  in  the  HMM.
General  Announce  Variant  (GAV)
This
  is  a  standard  model  (fixed  configuration).  GAVs  are 
announced  and  offered  to  all  customers.  The  MTM  portion 
of  the  machine  label  is  a  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  model, 
where  model  =  a  “fixed  part  number”,  not  “CTO”  (Example: 
1829-F1U).  Also,  PEW,  eSupport,  and  the  HMM  will  list 
these  products  under  the  same  fixed  model  number. 
FRU  identification  for  CTO,  CMV,  and 
GAV  products 
There  are  three  information  resources  to  identify  which 
FRUs  are  used  to  support  CTO,  CMV,  and  GAV  products. 
These  sources  are  PEW,  eSupport,  and  the  HMM. 
Using  PEW 
v    PEW  is  the  primary  source  for  identifying  FRU  part 
numbers  and  FRU  descriptions  for  the  key  commodities 
for  CTO,  CMV  and  GAV  products  at  a  MT  -  serial 
number  level.  An  example  of  key  commodities  are  hard 
disk  drives,  system  boards,  microprocessors,  Liquid 
Crystal  Displays  (LCDs),  and  memory. 
v    Remember,  All  CTO  and  CMV  products  are  loaded  in 
PEW  under  the  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  model,  where 
model  =  “CTO”  (Example:  1829-CTO).  GAVs  are  loaded 
in  PEW  under  the  4-digit  MT  and  3-digit  model,  where 
model  =  a  “fixed  part  number”,  not  “CTO”  (Example: 
1829-F1U). 
v    PEW  can  be  accessed  at  the  following  Web  site: 
http://w3-3.ibm.com/pc/entitle 
Click  on  MACHINE  LOOKUP,  followed  by  WARRANTY 
INFORMATION.  Input  the  MT  and  the  Serial  number 
and  the  list  of  key  commodities  will  be  returned  in  the 
PEW  record  under  COMPONENT  INFORMATION. 
v    Business  Partners  using  Eclaim  will  access  PEW  when 
performing  Entitlement  Lookup.  Business  Partners  will 
enter  Loc  ID,  MT  and  Serial,  and  the  key  commodities 
will  be  returned  in  the  Eclaim  record  under  SYSTEM 
DETAILS. 
v    Authorized  IBM  Business  Partners  can  access  Eclaim  at 
the  following  Web  site:  https://wca.eclaim.com

v    eSupport  can  be  used  to  view  the  list  of  key 
commodities  built  in  a  particular  machine  serial  (this  is 
the  same  record  found  in  PEW). 
v    eSupport  can  be  accessed  at  the  following  Web  site: 
http://www.lenovo.com/think/  support 
v    To  view  the  key  commodities,  click  on  PARTS 
INFORMATION,  then  PARTS  LOOKUP.  Type  in  the 
model  type  and  serial  number.  The  key  commodities  will 
be  returned  in  the  eSupport  record  under  PARTS 
SHIPPED  WITH  YOUR  SYSTEM. 
For  the  Remaining  FRUs  (the  complete  list  of  FRUs  at 
the  MT  Model  level) 
v    eSupport  can  be  used  to  view  the  complete  list  of  FRUs 
for  a  machine  type  and  model. 
v    To  view  the  complete  list  of  FRUs,  type  in  the  machine 
type  and  model  (Example:  1829-CTO)  under  QUICK 
PATH.  Under  “View  by  Document  Type”  select  PARTS 
INFORMATION.  Under  “Filter  by  Category”  select 
SERVICE  PARTS.  Under  “Parts  Information  by  Date” 
select  SYSTEM  SERVICE  PARTS.  The  list  of  service 
parts  by  description,  with  applicable  machine  type  model 
and  FRU  will  be  displayed.
Using  the  HMM 
Use  the  HMM  as  a  back-up  to  PEW  and  eSupport  to  view 
the  complete  list  of  FRUs  at  the  MT  Model  level.

Important  information  about  replacing 
RoHS  compliant  FRUs 
RoHS,  The  Restriction  of  Hazardous  Substances  in 
Electrical  and  Electronic  Equipment  Directive 
(2002/95/EC)  is  a  European  Union  legal  requirement 
affecting  the  global  electronics  industry.  RoHS 
requirements  must  be  implemented  on  Lenovo 
products  placed  on  the  market  after  June  2006. 
Products  on  the  market  before  June  2006  are  not 
required  to  have  RoHS  compliant  parts.  So,  if  the 
original  FRU  parts  are  non  compliant,  replacement 
parts  can  also  be  non  compliant.  In  all  cases  if  the 
original  FRU  parts  are  RoHS  compliant  the 
replacement  part  must  also  be  RoHS  compliant. 
Lenovo  plans  to  transition  to  RoHS  compliance  well  before 
the  implementation  date  and  expects  its  suppliers  to  be 
ready  to  support  Lenovo's  requirements  and  schedule. 
Products  sold  in  2005,  will  contain  some  RoHS  compliant 
FRUs.  The  following  statement  pertains  to  these  products 
and  any  product  Lenovo  produces  containing  RoHS 
compliant  FRUs. 
RoHS  compliant  FRUs  have  unique  FRU  part  numbers. 
Before  or  after  the  RoHS  implementation  date,  failed  RoHS 
compliant  parts  must  always  be  replaced  using  RoHS 
compliant  FRUs,  so  only  the  FRUs  identified  as  compliant 
in  the  system  HMM  or  direct  substitutions  for  those  FRUs 
may  be  used.

Before  the  computer  is  powered  on  after  FRU 
replacement,  make  sure  all  screws,  springs,  and  other 
small  parts  are  in  place  and  are  not  left  loose  inside 
the  computer.  Verify  this  by  shaking  the  computer  and 
listening  for  rattling  sounds.  Metallic  parts  or  metal 
flakes  can  cause  electrical  shorts. 
Avant  de  remettre  l’ordinateur  sous  tension  après 
remplacement  d’une  unité  en  clientèle,  vérifiez  que 
tous  les  ressorts,  vis  et  autres  pièces  sont  bien  en 
place  et  bien  fixées.  Pour  ce  faire,  secouez  l’unité  et 
assurez-vous  qu’aucun  bruit  suspect  ne  se  produit.  Des 
pièces  métalliques  ou  des  copeaux  de  métal  pourraient 
causer  un  court-circuit. 
Bevor  nach  einem  FRU-Austausch  der  Computer 
wieder  angeschlossen  wird,  muß  sichergestellt  werden, 
daß  keine  Schrauben,  Federn  oder  andere  Kleinteile 
fehlen  oder  im  Gehäuse  vergessen  wurden.  Der 
Computer  muß  geschüttelt  und  auf  Klappergeräusche 
geprüft  werden.  Metallteile  oder-splitter  können 
Kurzschlüsse  erzeugen. 
  
Prima  di  accendere  l’elaboratore  dopo  che  é  stata 
effettuata  la  sostituzione  di  una  FRU,  accertarsi  che 
tutte  le  viti,  le  molle  e  tutte  le  altri  parti  di  piccole 
dimensioni  siano  nella  corretta  posizione  e  non  siano 
sparse  all’interno  dell’elaboratore.  Verificare  ciò 
scuotendo  l’elaboratore  e  prestando  attenzione  ad 
eventuali  rumori;  eventuali  parti  o  pezzetti  metallici 
possono  provocare  cortocircuiti  pericolosi. 
Antes  de  encender  el  sistema  despues  de  sustituir  una 
FRU,  compruebe  que  todos  los  tornillos,  muelles  y 
demás  piezas  pequeñas  se  encuentran  en  su  sitio  y  no 
se  encuentran  sueltas  dentro  del  sistema.

Safety  information 
The  following  section  presents  safety  information  with 
which  you  need  to  be  familiar  before  you  service  a 
ThinkPad  computer. 
General  safety 
Follow  these  rules  to  ensure  general  safety: 
v    Observe  good  housekeeping  in  the  area  of  the 
machines  during  and  after  maintenance. 
v    When  lifting  any  heavy  object: 
1.    Make  sure  that  you  can  stand  safely  without 
slipping. 
2.    Distribute  the  weight  of  the  object  equally  between 
your  feet. 
3.    Use  a  slow  lifting  force.  Never  move  suddenly  or 
twist  when  you  attempt  to  lift. 
4.    Lift  by  standing  or  by  pushing  up  with  your  leg 
muscles;  this  action  removes  the  strain  from  the 
muscles  in  your  back.  Do  not  attempt  to  lift  any 
object  that  weighs  more  than  16  kg  (35  lb)  or  that 
you  think  is  too  heavy  for  you.
v    Do  not  perform  any  action  that  causes  hazards  to  the 
customer,  or  that  makes  the  equipment  unsafe. 
v    Before  you  start  the  machine,  make  sure  that  other 
service  representatives  and  the  customer’s  personnel 
are  not  in  a  hazardous  position. 
v    Place  removed  covers  and  other  parts  in  a  safe  place, 
away  from  all  personnel,  while  you  are  servicing  the 
machine. 
v    Keep  your  toolcase  away  from  walk  areas  so  that  other 
people  will  not  trip  over  it. 
v    Do  not  wear  loose  clothing  that  can  be  trapped  in  the 
moving  parts  of  a  machine.  Make  sure  that  your  sleeves 
are  fastened  or  rolled  up  above  your  elbows.  If  your  hair 
is  long,  fasten  it. 
v    Insert  the  ends  of  your  necktie  or  scarf  inside  clothing  or 
fasten  it  with  a  nonconductive  clip,  about  8  centimeters 
(3  inches)  from  the  end. 
v    Do  not  wear  jewelry,  chains,  metal-frame  eyeglasses,  or 
metal  fasteners  for  your  clothing. 
 
Attention:   Metal  objects  are  good  electrical 
conductors. 
v    Wear  safety  glasses  when  you  are  hammering,  drilling, 
soldering,  cutting  wire,  attaching  springs,  using  solvents, 
or  working  in  any  other  conditions  that  might  be 
hazardous  to  your  eyes.

v    After  service,  reinstall  all  safety  shields,  guards,  labels, 
and  ground  wires.  Replace  any  safety  device  that  is 
worn  or  defective. 
v    Reinstall  all  covers  correctly  before  returning  the 
machine  to  the  customer. 
v    Fan  louvers  on  the  machine  help  to  prevent  overheating 
of  internal  components.  Do  not  obstruct  fan  louvers  or 
cover  them  with  labels  or  stickers.
 
 
WARNING 
Handling  the  cord  on  this  product  or  cords 
associated  with  accessories  sold  with  this  product 
will  expose  you  to  lead,  a  chemical  known  to  the 
State  of  California  to  cause  cancer,  and  birth  defects 
or  other  reproductive  harm.  Wash  hands  after 
handling.
Electrical  safety 
Observe  the  following  rules  when  working  on  electrical 
equipment. 
 
 
Important 
Use  only  approved  tools  and  test  equipment.  Some 
hand  tools  have  handles  covered  with  a  soft 
material  that  does  not  insulate  you  when  working 
with  live  electrical  currents. 
Many  customers  have,  near  their  equipment,  rubber 
floor  mats  that  contain  small  conductive  fibers  to 
decrease  electrostatic  discharges.  Do  not  use  this 
type  of  mat  to  protect  yourself  from  electrical  shock. 
v    Find  the  room  emergency  power-off  (EPO)  switch, 
disconnecting  switch,  or  electrical  outlet.  If  an  electrical 
accident  occurs,  you  can  then  operate  the  switch  or 
unplug  the  power  cord  quickly. 
v    Do  not  work  alone  under  hazardous  conditions  or  near 
equipment  that  has  hazardous  voltages. 
v    Disconnect  all  power  before: 
–    Performing  a  mechanical  inspection 
–    Working  near  power  supplies 
–    Removing  or  installing  main  units
v
    Before  you  start  to  work  on  the  machine,  unplug  the 
power  cord.  If  you  cannot  unplug  it,  ask  the  customer  to 
power-off  the  wall  box  that  supplies  power  to  the 
machine,  and  to  lock  the  wall  box  in  the  off  position. 
v    If  you  need  to  work  on  a  machine  that  has  exposed 
electrical  circuits,  observe  the  following  precautions: 
Safety  information 
Introduction  21

--- Page 26 ---
–    Ensure  that  another  person,  familiar  with  the 
power-off  controls,  is  near  you. 
 
Attention:   Another  person  must  be  there  to  switch 
off  the  power,  if  necessary. 
–    Use  only  one  hand  when  working  with  powered-on 
electrical  equipment;  keep  the  other  hand  in  your 
pocket  or  behind  your  back. 
 
Attention:   An  electrical  shock  can  occur  only  when 
there  is  a  complete  circuit.  By  observing  the  above 
rule,  you  may  prevent  a  current  from  passing  through 
your  body. 
–    When  using  testers,  set  the  controls  correctly  and 
use  the  approved  probe  leads  and  accessories  for 
that  tester. 
–    Stand  on  suitable  rubber  mats  (obtained  locally,  if 
necessary)  to  insulate  you  from  grounds  such  as 
metal  floor  strips  and  machine  frames.
Observe  the  special  safety  precautions  when  you  work 
with  very  high  voltages;  Instructions  for  these 
precautions  are  in  the  safety  sections  of  maintenance 
information.  Use  extreme  care  when  measuring  high 
voltages. 
v    Regularly  inspect  and  maintain  your  electrical  hand  tools 
for  safe  operational  condition. 
v    Do  not  use  worn  or  broken  tools  and  testers. 
v    Never  assume  that  power  has  been  disconnected  from 
a  circuit.  First,  check  that  it  has  been  powered  off. 
v    Always  look  carefully  for  possible  hazards  in  your  work 
area.  Examples  of  these  hazards  are  moist  floors, 
nongrounded  power  extension  cables,  power  surges, 
and  missing  safety  grounds. 
v    Do  not  touch  live  electrical  circuits  with  the  reflective 
surface  of  a  plastic  dental  mirror.  The  surface  is 
conductive;  such  touching  can  cause  personal  injury  and 
machine  damage. 
v    Do  not  service  the  following  parts  with  the  power  on 
when  they  are  removed  from  their  normal  operating 
places  in  a  machine: 
–    Power  supply  units 
–    Pumps 
–    Blowers  and  fans 
–    Motor  generators
and
  similar  units.  (This  practice  ensures  correct 
grounding  of  the  units.) 
v    If  an  electrical  accident  occurs: 
–    Use  caution;  do  not  become  a  victim  yourself. 
–    Switch  off  power. 
–    Send  another  person  to  get  medical  aid.

Safety  inspection  guide 
The  purpose  of  this  inspection  guide  is  to  assist  you  in 
identifying  potentially  unsafe  conditions.  As  each  machine 
was  designed  and  built,  required  safety  items  were 
installed  to  protect  users  and  service  personnel  from  injury. 
This  guide  addresses  only  those  items.  You  should  use 
good  judgment  to  identify  potential  safety  hazards  due  to 
attachment  of  non-ThinkPad  features  or  options  not 
covered  by  this  inspection  guide. 
If  any  unsafe  conditions  are  present,  you  must  determine 
how  serious  the  apparent  hazard  could  be  and  whether 
you  can  continue  without  first  correcting  the  problem. 
Consider  these  conditions  and  the  safety  hazards  they 
present: 
v    Electrical  hazards,  especially  primary  power  (primary 
voltage  on  the  frame  can  cause  serious  or  fatal 
electrical  shock) 
v    Explosive  hazards,  such  as  a  damaged  CRT  face  or  a 
bulging  capacitor 
v    Mechanical  hazards,  such  as  loose  or  missing  hardware
To
  determine  whether  there  are  any  potentially  unsafe 
conditions,  use  the  following  checklist  at  the  beginning  of 
every  service  task.  Begin  the  checks  with  the  power  off, 
and  the  power  cord  disconnected. 
Checklist: 
1.    Check  exterior  covers  for  damage  (loose,  broken,  or 
sharp  edges). 
2.    Power  off  the  computer.  Disconnect  the  power  cord. 
3.    Check  the  power  cord  for: 
a.    A  third-wire  ground  connector  in  good  condition. 
Use  a  meter  to  measure  third-wire  ground 
continuity  for  0.1  ohm  or  less  between  the  external 
ground  pin  and  the  frame  ground. 
b.    The  power  cord  should  be  the  type  specified  in  the 
parts  list. 
c.    Insulation  must  not  be  frayed  or  worn.
4.
    Remove  the  cover. 
5.    Check  for  any  obvious  non-ThinkPad  alterations.  Use 
good  judgment  as  to  the  safety  of  any  non-ThinkPad 
alterations. 
6.    Check  inside  the  unit  for  any  obvious  unsafe 
conditions,  such  as  metal  filings,  contamination,  water 
or  other  liquids,  or  signs  of  fire  or  smoke  damage. 
7.    Check  for  worn,  frayed,  or  pinched  cables.

8.    Check  that  the  power-supply  cover  fasteners  (screws 
or  rivets)  have  not  been  removed  or  tampered  with.
Handling  devices  that  are  sensitive  to 
electrostatic  discharge 
Any  computer  part  containing  transistors  or  integrated 
circuits  (ICs)  should  be  considered  sensitive  to  electrostatic 
discharge  (ESD.)  ESD  damage  can  occur  when  there  is  a 
difference  in  charge  between  objects.  Protect  against  ESD 
damage  by  equalizing  the  charge  so  that  the  machine,  the 
part,  the  work  mat,  and  the  person  handling  the  part  are  all 
at  the  same  charge. 
 
 
Notes 
1.    Use  product-specific  ESD  procedures  when  they 
exceed  the  requirements  noted  here. 
2.    Make  sure  that  the  ESD  protective  devices  you 
use  have  been  certified  (ISO  9000)  as  fully 
effective.
 When  handling  ESD-sensitive  parts: 
v    Keep  the  parts  in  protective  packages  until  they  are 
inserted  into  the  product. 
v    Avoid  contact  with  other  people. 
v    Wear  a  grounded  wrist  strap  against  your  skin  to 
eliminate  static  on  your  body. 
v    Prevent  the  part  from  touching  your  clothing.  Most 
clothing  is  insulative  and  retains  a  charge  even  when 
you  are  wearing  a  wrist  strap. 
v    Use  the  black  side  of  a  grounded  work  mat  to  provide  a 
static-free  work  surface.  The  mat  is  especially  useful 
when  handling  ESD-sensitive  devices. 
v    Select  a  grounding  system,  such  as  those  listed  below, 
to  provide  protection  that  meets  the  specific  service 
requirement. 
 
 
Note 
The  use  of  a  grounding  system  to  guard  against 
ESD  damage  is  desirable  but  not  necessary.
–    Attach  the  ESD  ground  clip  to  any  frame  ground, 
ground  braid,  or  green-wire  ground. 
–    When  working  on  a  double-insulated  or 
battery-operated  system,  use  an  ESD  common 
ground  or  reference  point.  You  can  use  coax  or 
connector-outside  shells  on  these  systems.

–    Use  the  round  ground  prong  of  the  ac  plug  on 
ac-operated  computers.
Grounding  requirements 
Electrical  grounding  of  the  computer  is  required  for 
operator  safety  and  correct  system  function.  Proper 
grounding  of  the  electrical  outlet  can  be  verified  by  a 
certified  electrician.

for  DOS  diagnostics 
program.  Some  descriptions  might  not  apply  to  your 
particular  computer. 
Read  this  first 
Before  you  go  to  the  checkout  guide,  be  sure  to  read  this 
section. 
 
 
Important  notes 
v    Only  certified  trained  personnel  should 
service  the  computer. 
v    Before  replacing  any  FRU,  read  the  entire 
page  on  removing  and  replacing  FRUs. 
v    When  you  replace  FRUs,  use  new 
nylon-coated  screws. 
v    Be  extremely  careful  during  such  write 
operations  as  copying,  saving,  or  formatting. 
Drives  in  the  computer  that  you  are  servicing 
sequence  might  have  been  altered.  If  you  select 
an  incorrect  drive,  data  or  programs  might  be 
overwritten. 
v    Replace  an  FRU  only  with  another  FRU  of  the 
correct  model.  When  you  replace  a  FRU,  make 
sure  that  the  model  of  the  machine  and  the  FRU 
part  number  are  correct  by  referring  to  the  FRU

Passwords 
As  many  as  three  passwords  may  be  needed  for  any 
ThinkPad  computer:  the  power-on  password  (POP),  the 
hard-disk  password  (HDP),  and  the  supervisor  password 
(SVP). 
If  any  of  these  passwords  has  been  set,  a  prompt  for  it 
appears  on  the  screen  whenever  the  computer  is  turned 
on.  The  computer  does  not  start  until  the  password  is 
entered. 
Exception:   If  only  an  SVP  is  installed,  the  password 
prompt  does  not  appear  when  the  operating 
system  is  booted. 
Power-on  password: 
A  power-on  password  (POP)  protects  the  system  from 
being  powered  on  by  an  unauthorized  person.  The 
password  must  be  entered  before  an  operating  system  can 
be  booted. 
Hard-disk  password: 
There  are  two  hard-disk  passwords  (HDPs): 
v    User  HDP—for  the  user 
v    Master  HDP—for  the  system  administrator,  who  can  use 
it  to  get  access  to  the  hard  disk  even  if  the  user  has 
changed  the  user  HDP
Note:   There  are  two  modes  for  the  HDP:  User  only  and 
Master  +  User.  The  Master  +  User  mode  requires 
two  HDPs;  the  system  administrator  enters  both  in 
the  same  operation.  The  system  administrator  then 
provides  the  user  HDP  to  the  system  user.
 Attention:   If  the  user  HDP  has  been  forgotten,  check 
whether  a  master  HDP  has  been  set.  If  it  has,  it  can  be 
used  for  access  to  the  hard  disk  drive.  If  no  master  HDP  is 
available,  neither  Lenovo  nor  Lenovo  authorized  servicers 
provide  any  services  to  reset  either  the  user  or  the  master 
HDP,  or  to  recover  data  from  the  hard  disk  drive.  The  hard 
disk  drive  can  be  replaced  for  a  scheduled  fee.

--- Page 37 ---
Supervisor  password: 
A  supervisor  password  (SVP)  protects  the  system 
information  stored  in  the  BIOS  Setup  Utility.  The  SVP  must 
be  entered  in  order  to  get  access  to  the  BIOS  Setup  Utility 
and  make  changes  to  system  configuration  settings. 
 
Attention:   If  the  SVP  has  been  forgotten  and  cannot  be 
made  available  to  the  servicer,  there  is  no  service 
procedure  to  reset  the  password.  The  system  board  must 
be  replaced  for  a  scheduled  fee. 
How  to  remove  the  power-on  password 
To  remove  a  POP  that  you  have  forgotten,  do  the 
following: 
(A)  If  no  SVP  has  been  set: 
1.    Turn  off  the  computer. 
2.    Remove  the  battery  pack. 
For  how  to  remove  the  battery  pack,  see  “1010  Battery

Backup  battery”  on  page  81. 
4.    Turn  on  the  computer  and  wait  until  the  POST  ends. 
After  the  POST  ends,  the  password  prompt  does  not 
appear.  The  POP  has  been  removed. 
5.    Reinstall  the  backup  battery  and  the  battery  pack. 
(B)  If  an  SVP  has  been  set  and  is  known  by  the  servicer:

Power  management 
To  reduce  power  consumption,  the  computer  has  three 
power  management  modes:  screen  blank,  standby,  and 
hibernation. 
Screen  blank  mode 
Screen  blank  mode  has  three  variants,  as  follows: 
1.    If  you  press  Fn+F3,  or  if  the  time  set  on  the  “LCD  off 
timer”  in  the  BIOS  Setup  Utility  expires, 
v    The  LCD  backlight  turns  off. 
v    The  hard  disk  drive  motor  stops. 
v    The  speaker  is  muted.
2.    If  you  are  using  the  ACPI  operating  system  and  you 
press  Fn+F3, 
v    The  LCD  backlight  turns  off. 
v    The  hard  disk  drive  motor  stops.
3.    If  the  time  set  on  the  “Turn  off  monitor”  timer  in  the 
operating  system  expires, 
v    The  LCD  backlight  turns  off. 
To  end  screen  blank  mode  and  resume  normal  operation, 
press  any  key. 
Standby  mode 
When  the  computer  enters  standby  mode,  the  following 
events  occur  in  addition  to  what  occurs  in  screen  blank 
mode: 
v    The  LCD  is  powered  off. 
v    The  hard  disk  drive  is  powered  off. 
v    The  CPU  stops. 
To  enter  standby  mode,  press  Fn+F4. 
Note:   If  you  are  using  the  ACPI  operating  system,  you  can 
change  the  action  of  Fn+F4. 
In  certain  circumstances,  the  computer  goes  into  standby 
mode  automatically: 
v    If  a  “suspend  time”  has  been  set  on  the  timer,  and  the 
user  does  not  do  any  operation  with  the  keyboard,  the 
TrackPoint
®
,  the  hard  disk,  the  parallel  connector,  or  the 
diskette  drive  within  that  time. 
v    If  the  battery  indicator  blinks  orange,  indicating  that  the 
battery  power  is  low.  (Alternatively,  if  Hibernate  when 
battery  becomes  low  has  been  selected  in  the  “Power 
Management  Properties”  window,  the  computer  goes 
into  hibernation  mode.)

General  descriptions  37

--- Page 42 ---
Note  for  the  APM  operating  system:
Even
  if  you  do  not  set  the  low-battery  alarm,  the  charge 
indicator  notifies  you  when  the  battery  is  low,  and  then  the 
computer  enters  the  power-saving  mode  automatically. 
This  default  low-battery  behavior  is  independent  of  the 
operating  system;  so  if  you  have  set  the  low-battery  alarm, 
the  computer  may  not  do  what  you  specified.  It  chooses 
either  your  setting  or  the  default  setting,  whichever  is 
appropriate. 
If  you  are  using  the  ACPI  operating  system,  only  the 
low-battery  alarm  is  available. 
To  cause  the  computer  to  return  from  standby  mode  and 
resume  operation,  do  one  of  the  following: 
v    Press  the  Fn  key. 
v    Open  the  LCD  cover. 
v    Turn  on  the  power  switch. 
Also,  in  either  of  the  following  events,  the  computer 
automatically  returns  from  standby  mode  and  resumes 
operation:
v
    The  ring  indicator  (RI)  is  signaled  by  a  serial  device  or  a 
PC  Card  device. 
v    The  time  set  on  the  resume  timer  elapses. 
Note:   The  computer  does  not  accept  any  input 
immediately  after  it  enters  standby  mode.  Wait  a 
few  seconds  before  taking  any  action  to  reenter 
operation  mode.
Hibernation  mode 
In  hibernation  mode,  the  following  occurs: 
v    The  system  status,  RAM,  VRAM,  and  setup  data  are 
stored  on  the  hard  disk. 
v    The  system  is  powered  off.
Note:   If  the  computer  enters  the  hibernation  mode  while  it 
is  docked  to  the  docking  station,  do  not  undock  it 
before  resuming  normal  operation.  If  you  do  undock 
it  and  then  try  to  resume  normal  operation,  you  will 
get  an  error  message,  and  you  will  have  to  restart 
the  system. 
To  cause  the  computer  to  enter  hibernation  mode,  do  any 
of  the  following: 
v    Press  the  Fn+F12  keys. 
v    If  you  are  using  the  APM  operating  system  and  have  set 
the  mode  to  Power  switch  mode  [Hibernation],  turn 
off  the  power  switch.

38  MT  2672,  2673,  2884,  2885

--- Page 43 ---
v    If  you  are  using  the  ACPI  operating  system  and  have 
defined  one  of  the  following  actions  as  the  event  that 
causes  the  system  to  go  into  hibernation  mode,  perform 
that  action. 
–    Closing  the  lid. 
–    Pressing  the  power  button. 
–    Pressing  Fn+F4  keys.
Also,  the  computer  goes  into  hibernation  mode 
automatically  in  either  of  the  following  conditions:
v    If  a  “hibernation  time”  has  been  set  on  the  timer,  and  if 
the  user  does  not  do  any  operation  with  the  keyboard, 
the  TrackPoint,  the  hard  disk  drive,  the  parallel 
connector,  or  the  diskette  drive  within  that  time. 
v    If  the  timer  conditions  are  satisfied  in  suspend  mode. 
v    If  you  are  using  the  APM  operating  system  and  have  set 
the  mode  to  Hibernate  when  battery  becomes  low, 
and  the  battery  charge  becomes  critically  low. 
When  the  power  is  turned  on,  the  computer  returns  from 
hibernation  mode  and  resumes  operation.  The  hibernation 
file  in  the  boot  record  on  the  hard  disk  drive  is  read,  and 
system  status  is  restored  from  the  hard  disk  drive.

Use  the  following  procedures  as  a  guide  in  identifying  and 
correcting  problems  with  the  ThinkPad  computer. 
Note:   The  diagnostic  tests  are  intended  to  test  only 
ThinkPad  products.  The  use  of  non-ThinkPad 
products,  prototype  cards,  or  modified  options  can 
lead  to  false  indications  of  errors  and  invalid  system 
responses. 
1.    Identify  the  failing  symptoms  in  as  much  detail  as 
possible. 
2.    Verify  the  symptoms.  Try  to  re-create  the  failure  by 
running  the  diagnostic  test  or  by  repeating  the 
operation.
Testing  the  computer 
The  ThinkPad  computer  has  a  test  program  called 
PC-Doctor  for  DOS  (hereafter  called  PC-Doctor).  You  can 
detect  errors  by  running  the  diagnostics  test  included  in 
PC-Doctor.  This  section  is  an  overview  of  the  procedure. 
For  details  that  depend  on  model-unique  functions,  refer  to 
“Product  overview”  on  page  49. 
For  some  possible  configurations  of  the  computer, 
PC-Doctor  might  not  run  correctly.  To  avoid  this  problem, 
you  need  to  initialize  the  computer  setup  by  use  of  the 
BIOS  Setup  Utility  before  you  run  PC-Doctor.  On  the  BIOS 
Setup  Utility  screen,  press  F9,  Enter,  F10,  and  then  Enter. 
Note:   When  you  initialize  the  computer  configuration, 
some  devices  are  disabled,  such  as  the  serial  port. 
If  you  test  one  of  these  devices,  you  will  need  to 
enable  it  by  using  Configuration  utility  for  DOS.  The 
utility  is  available  on  the  following  Web  site: 
http://www.lenovo.com/think/  support 
PC-Doctor  cannot  be  used  to  test  a  device  that  is  in  the 
docking  station,  even  if  the  computer  supports  the  docking 
station.  To  test  a  USB  device,  connect  it  to  the  USB 
connector  of  the  computer.  To  test  the  Ultrabay  device, 
install  it  in  the  Ultrabay  Plus  slot  of  the  computer.

Creating  the  PC-Doctor  diagnostics  diskette 
In  X31  and  X32  series,  the  PC-Doctor  disk  can  be 
created  by  using  the  Access  IBM  Predesktop  Area. 
To  create  the  PC-Doctor  disk  from  the  Access  IBM 
Predesktop  Area,  do  as  follows: 
1.    Enter  the  IBM  Predesktop  application  by 
pressing  the  Access  IBM  button  during  POST. 
2.    When  the  Access  IBM  application  finishes 
loading,  double-click  the  “Create  Diagnostic

digital  signature,  and  then  the  ThinkPad 
computer  will  reboot  into  PC-DOS. 
4.    A  batch  file  will  automatically  start  up  to  prompt 
the  user  through  creating  the  boot  diskettes.  The 
user  will  be  informed  how  many  diskettes  will  be 
needed. 
a.    The  user  will  be  prompted  to  insert  each 
diskette  in  sequence. 
b.    Typically,  the  user  only  needs  to  press  the 
Enter  key  for  the  proper  floppy  drive  to 
format  and  create  the  diskette. 
c.    Each  diskette  will  be  erased  and  formatted 
with  the  PC-Doctor  for  DOS  boot  image.
5.    Once  all  the  diskettes  have  been  created,  the 
ThinkPad  computer  will  reboot.  The  user  is 
asked  to  remove  all  diskettes  from  the  drive,  or 
to  insert  the  first  diskette  created  if  it  is  desired 
to  run  the  diagnostics.
 To  run  the  test,  do  as  follows: 
Note:   In  the  following  procedure,  you  can  select  an  item 
not  only  with  the  arrow  keys,  but  also  with  the 
TrackPoint.  Instead  of  pressing  Enter,  click  the  left 
button. 
1.    Insert  the  PC-Doctor  disk  into  the  diskette  drive;  then 
power  on  the  computer.

Checking  the  ac  adapter 
You  are  here  because  the  computer  fails  only  when  the  ac 
adapter  is  used: 
v    If  the  power  problem  occurs  only  when  the  port 
replicator  is  used,  replace  the  port  replicator. 
v    If  the  power-on  indicator  does  not  turn  on,  check  the 
power  cord  of  the  ac  adapter  for  correct  continuity  and 
installation. 
v    If  the  computer  does  not  charge  during  operation,  go  to 
″Checking  operational  charging.″ 
To  check  the  ac  adapter,  do  the  following: 
1.    Unplug  the  ac  adapter  cable  from  the  computer. 
2.    Measure  the  output  voltage  at  the  plug  of  the  ac 
adapter  cable.  See  the  following  figure:

(16-10V)
 
 
Pin  Voltage  (V  dc) 
1  +15.5  to  +17.0 
2  Ground 
  
3.    If  the  voltage  is  not  correct,  replace  the  ac  adapter. 
4.    If  the  voltage  is  acceptable,  do  the  following: 
v    Replace  the  system  board. 
v    If  the  problem  persists,  go  to  “Product  overview”  on 
page  49.
Note:   Noise  from  the  ac  adapter  does  not  always  indicate 
a  defect.

Checking  operational  charging 
To  check  whether  the  battery  charges  properly  during 
operation,  use  a  discharged  battery  pack  or  a  battery  pack 
that  has  less  than  50%  of  the  total  power  remaining  when 
installed  in  the  computer. 
Perform  operational  charging.  If  the  battery  status  indicator 
or  icon  does  not  turn  on,  remove  the  battery  pack  and  let  it 
return  to  room  temperature.  Reinstall  the  battery  pack.  If 
the  charge  indicator  or  icon  still  does  not  turn  on,  replace 
the  battery  pack. 
If  the  charge  indicator  still  does  not  turn  on,  replace  the 
system  board.  Then  reinstall  the  battery  pack.  If  it  is  still 
not  charged,  go  to  the  next  section. 
Checking  the  battery  pack 
Battery  charging  does  not  start  until  the  Power  Meter 
shows  that  less  than  95%  of  the  total  power  remains; 
under  this  condition  the  battery  pack  can  charge  to  100% 
of  its  capacity.  This  protects  the  battery  pack  from  being 
overcharged  or  from  having  a  shortened  life. 
To  check  the  status  of  your  battery,  move  your  cursor  to 
the  Power  Meter  icon  in  the  icon  tray  of  the  Windows 
taskbar  and  wait  for  a  moment  (but  do  not  click),  and  the 
percentage  of  battery  power  remaining  is  displayed.  To   get 
detailed  information  about  the  battery,  double-click  the 
Power  Meter  icon. 
Note:   If  the  battery  pack  becomes  hot,  it  may  not  be  able 
to  charge.  Remove  it  from  the  computer  and  leave  it 
at  room  temperature  for  a  while.  After  it  cools  down, 
reinstall  and  recharge  it. 
To  check  the  battery  pack,  do  the  following: 
1.    Power  off  the  computer. 
2.    Remove  the  battery  pack  and  measure  the  voltage 
between  battery  terminals  1  (+)  and  5  (−).  See  the 
following  figure: 
 
5(-)
1(+)
4

2
 
 
Terminal  Voltage  (V  dc) 
1  +  0  to  +  12.6 
5  Ground  (−) 
  
3.    If  the  voltage  is  less  than  +11.0  V  dc,  the  battery  pack 
has  been  discharged.

General  descriptions  45

--- Page 50 ---
Note:   Recharging  will  take  at  least  3  hours,  even  if  the 
indicator  does  not  turn  on. 
If  the  voltage  is  still  less  than  +11.0  V  dc  after 
recharging,  replace  the  battery. 
4.    If  the  voltage  is  more  than  +11.0  V  dc,  measure  the 
resistance  between  battery  terminals  4  and  5.  The 
resistance  must  be  4  to  30  K  . 
If  the  resistance  is  not  correct,  replace  the  battery 
pack.  If  the  resistance  is  correct,  replace  the  system 
board.
Checking  the  backup  battery 
Do  the  following: 
1.    Power  off  the  computer,  and  unplug  the  ac  adapter 
from  it. 
2.    Turn  the  computer  upside  down. 
3.    Remove  the  battery  pack  (see  “1010  Battery  pack”  on 
page  76). 
4.    Remove  the  backup  battery  (see  “Checking  the  battery 
pack”  on  page  45). 
5.    Measure  the  voltage  of  the  backup  battery.  See  the 
following  figure.
 
Red (+)
Black (-)
 
 
Wire  Voltage  (V  dc) 
Red  +2.5  to  +3.2

v    If  the  voltage  is  correct,  replace  the  system  board. 
v    If  the  voltage  is  not  correct,  replace  the  backup  battery. 
v    If  the  backup  battery  discharges  quickly  after 
replacement,  replace  the  system  board.

Symptom-to-FRU  index 
The  symptom-to-FRU  index  in  this  section  lists  symptoms 
and  errors  and  their  possible  causes.  The  most  likely 
cause  is  listed  first,  in  boldface  type. 
Note:   Do  the  FRU  replacement  or  other  actions  in  the 
sequence  shown  in  the  column  headed  “FRU  or 
action,  in  sequence.”  If  replacing  a  FRU  does  not 
solve  the  problem,  put  the  original  part  back  in  the 
computer.  Do  not  replace  a  nondefective  FRU. 
This  index  can  also  help  you  determine,  during  regular 
servicing,  what  FRUs  are  likely  to  need  to  be  replaced 
next. 
A  numeric  error  is  displayed  for  each  error  detected  in 
POST  or  system  operation.  In  the  displays,  n  can  be  any 
number. 
If  no  numeric  code  is  displayed,  check  the  narrative 
descriptions  of  symptoms.  If  the  symptom  is  not  described 
there,  go  to  “Intermittent  problems”  on  page  70.

always  lighted  is  characteristic  of  TFT  LCD 
technology,  but  excessive  pixel  problems  can  cause 
viewing  concerns.  The  LCD  should  be  replaced  if 
the  number  of  missing,  discolored,  or  lighted  dots  in 
any  background  is: 
v    XGA:  8  or  more  bright  dots,  8  or  more  dark  dots, 
or  a  total  of  9  or  more  bright  and  dark  dots.

Intermittent  problems 
Intermittent  system  hang  problems  can  be  due  to  a  variety 
of  causes  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  a  hardware  defect, 
such  as  cosmic  radiation,  electrostatic  discharge,  or 
software  errors.  FRU  replacement  should  be  considered 
only  when  a  problem  recurs. 
When  analyzing  an  intermittent  problem,  do  the  following: 
1.    Run  the  diagnostic  test  for  the  system  board  in  loop 
mode  at  least  10  times. 
2.    If  no  error  is  detected,  do  not  replace  any  FRUs. 
3.    If  any  error  is  detected,  replace  the  FRU  shown  by  the 
FRU  code.  Rerun  the  test  to  verify  that  no  more  errors 
exist.
Undetermined  problems 
If  the  diagnostic  tests  did  not  identify  the  adapter  or  device 
that  has  failed,  if  wrong  devices  are  installed,  or  if  the 
system  simply  is  not  operating,  follow  these  procedures  to 
isolate  the  failing  FRU  (do  not  isolate  FRUs  that  have  no 
defects). 
Verify  that  all  attached  devices  are  supported  by  the 
computer. 
Verify  that  the  power  supply  being  used  at  the  time  of  the 
failure  is  operating  correctly.  (See  “Power  system 
checkout”  on  page  44.) 
1.    Turn  off  the  computer. 
2.    Visually  check  each  FRU  for  damage.  Replace  any 
damaged  FRU. 
3.    Remove  or  disconnect  all  of  the  following  devices: 
a.    Non-ThinkPad  devices 
b.    Devices  attached  to  the  port  replicator 
c.    Printer,  mouse,  and  other  external  devices 
d.    Battery  pack 
e.    Hard  disk  drive 
f.    External  diskette  drive 
g.    DIMM 
h.    CD-ROM  and  diskette  drive  in  the  Ultrabay 
i.    PC  Cards
4.    Turn  on  the  computer. 
5.    Determine  whether  the  problem  has  been  solved. 
6.    If  the  problem  does  not  recur,  reconnect  the  removed 
devices  one  at  a  time  until  you  find  the  failing  FRU. 
7.    If  the  problem  remains,  replace  the  following  FRUs  one 
at  a  time  (do  not  replace  a  nondefective  FRU): 
a.    System  board 
b.    LCD  assembly

FRU  replacement  notices 
This  section  contains  notices  related  to  removing  and 
replacing  parts.  Read  this  section  carefully  before  replacing 
any  FRU. 
Screw  notices 
Loose  screws  can  cause  a  reliability  problem.  In  the  IBM 
ThinkPad  computer,  this  problem  is  addressed  with  special 
nylon-coated  screws  that  have  the  following  characteristics: 
v    They  maintain  tight  connections. 
v    They  do  not  easily  come  loose,  even  with  shock  or 
vibration. 
v    They  are  harder  to  tighten. 
v    Each  one  should  be  used  only  once.
Do
  the  following  when  you  service  this  machine: 
v    Keep  the  screw  kit  (for  the  P/N,  see  “Miscellaneous 
parts”  on  page  181)  in  your  tool  bag. 
v    Always  use  new  screws. 
v    Use  a  torque  screwdriver  if  you  have  one.
Tighten
  screws  as  follows: 
v    Plastic  to  plastic 
Turn  an  additional  90  degrees  after  the  screw  head 
touches  the  surface  of  the  plastic  part: 
90 degrees more
(Cross-section)
  
  
v    Logic  card  to  plastic 
Turn  an  additional  180  degrees  after  the  screw  head 
touches  the  surface  of  the  logic  card: 
180 degrees more
(Cross-section)
  
  
v    Torque  driver 
If  you  have  a  torque  driver,  refer  to  the  “Torque”  column 
for  each  step.

v    Make  sure  that  you  use  the  correct  screw.  If  you  have  a 
torque  screwdriver,  tighten  all  screws  firmly  to  the  torque 
shown  in  the  table.  Never  use  a  screw  that  you 
removed.  Use  a  new  one.  Make  sure  that  all  of  the 
screws  are  tightened  firmly.
Retaining  serial  numbers 
This  section  includes  the  following  descriptions: 
v    “Restoring  the  serial  number  of  the  system  unit” 
v    “Retaining  the  UUID”  on  page  73 
v    “Reading  or  writing  the  ECA  information”  on  page  73
Restoring  the  serial  number  of  the  system 
unit 
When  the  computer  was  manufactured,  the  EEPROM  on 
the  system  board  was  loaded  with  the  serial  numbers  of 
the  system  and  all  major  components.  These  numbers 
need  to  remain  the  same  throughout  the  life  of  the 
computer. 
If  you  replace  the  system  board,  you  must  restore  the 
serial  number  of  the  system  unit  to  its  original  value. 
Before  replacing  the  system  board,  save  the  original  serial 
number  by  doing  the  following: 
1.    Install  the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance  Diskette 
Version  1.71  or  later,  and  restart  the  computer. 
2.    From  the  main  menu,  select  1.  Set  System 
Identification. 
3.    Select  2.  Read  S/N  data  from  EEPROM. 
The  serial  number  of  each  device  in  your  computer  is 
displayed;  the  serial  number  of  the  system  unit  is  listed  as 
follows: 
v    20:  Serial  number 
Write  down  that  number. 
Note:   The  serial  number  of  the  system  unit  is  also  written 
on  the  label  attached  to  the  bottom  of  the  computer. 
After  you  have  replaced  the  system  board,  restore  the 
serial  number  by  doing  the  following: 
1.    Install  the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance  Diskette 
Version  1.71  or  later  and  restart  the  computer. 
2.    From  the  main  menu,  select  1.  Set  System 
Identification. 
3.    Select  1.  Add  S/N  data  from  EEPROM. 
Follow  the  instructions  on  the  screen.

Retaining  the  UUID 
The  Universally  Unique  Identifier  (UUID)  is  a  128-bit 
number  uniquely  assigned  to  your  computer  at  production 
and  stored  in  the  EEPROM  of  your  system  board.  The 
algorithm  that  generates  the  number  is  designed  to  provide 
unique  IDs  until  the  year  A.D.  3400.  No  two  computers  in 
the  world  have  the  same  number. 
When  you  replace  the  system  board,  you  must  set  the 
UUID  on  the  new  system  board  as  follows: 
1.    Install  the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance  Diskette 
Version  1.71  or  later,  and  restart  the  computer. 
2.    From  the  main  menu,  select  4.  Assign  UUID. 
A  new  UUID  is  created  and  written.  If  a  valid  UUID 
already  exists,  it  is  not  overwritten.
Reading  or  writing  the  ECA  information 
Information  on  Engineering  Change  Announcements  (ECA) 
are  stored  in  the  EEPROM  of  the  system  board.  The 
electronic  storage  of  this  information  simplifies  the 
procedure  to  check  if  the  ECA  has  been  previously  applied 
to  a  machine.  The  machine  does  not  need  to  be 
disassembled  to  check  for  the  ECA  application. 
To  check  what  ECAs  have  been  previously  applied  to  the 
machine,  use  the  ECA  Information  Read/Write  function  on 
the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance  Diskette  Version  1.71 
or  later. 
1.    Insert  the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance  Diskette 
Version  1.71  or  later,  and  restart  the  computer. 
2.    From  the  main  menu,  select  6.  Set  ECA  Information. 
3.    To  read  ECA  information,  select  2.  Read  ECA/rework 
number  from  EEPROM  and  follow  the  instruction. 
4.    To  read  box  build  date,  select  5.  Read  box  build  date 
from  EEPROM,  and  follow  the  instruction  on  the 
screen. 
After  an  ECA  has  been  applied  to  the  machine,  the 
EEPROM  must  be  updated  to  reflect  the  ECA's 
application.  Use  the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance 
Diskette  Version  1.71  or  later  to  update  the  EEPROM. 
Note:   Only  the  ECA  number  is  stored  in  the  EEPROM. 
The  machine  type  of  the  ECA  is  assumed  be  the 
same  as  the  machine  type  of  the  machine  that  had 
the  ECA  applied  to  it. 
1.    Insert  the  ThinkPad  Hardware  Maintenance  Diskette 
Version  1.71  or  later,  and  restart  the  computer. 
2.    From  the  main  menu,  select  6.  Set  ECA  Information.

4.    To  write  box  build  date,  select  4.  Write  box  build  date 
from  EEPROM,  and  follow  the  instruction  on  the 
screen. 
If  the  system  board  is  being  replaced,  try  to  read  the  ECA 
information  from  the  old  system  board  and  transfer  the 
information  to  the  new  system.  If  the  system  board  is 
inoperable,  this  will  not  be  possible.

Removing  and  replacing  a  FRU 
This  section  presents  directions  and  drawings  for  use  in 
removing  and  replacing  a  FRU.  Be  sure  to  observe  the 
following  general  rules: 
1.    Do  not  try  to  service  any  computer  unless  you  have 
been  trained  and  certified.  An  untrained  person  runs 
the  risk  of  damaging  parts. 
2.    Before  replacing  any  FRU,  review  “FRU  replacement 
notices”  on  page  71. 
3.    Begin  by  removing  any  FRUs  that  have  to  be  removed 
before  the  failing  FRU.  Any  such  FRUs  are  listed  at  the 
top  of  the  page.  Remove  them  in  the  order  in  which 
they  are  listed. 
4.    Follow  the  correct  sequence  in  the  steps  for  removing 
the  FRU,  as  given  in  the  drawings  by  the  numbers  in 
square  callouts. 
5.    When  turning  a  screw  to  replace  a  FRU,  turn  it  in  the 
direction  as  given  by  the  arrow  in  the  drawing. 
6.    When  removing  the  FRU,  move  it  in  the  direction  as 
given  by  the  arrow  in  the  drawing. 
7.    To  put  the  new  FRU  in  place,  reverse  the  removal 
procedure  and  follow  any  notes  that  pertain  to 
replacement.  For  information  about  connecting  and 
arranging  internal  cables,  see  “Locations”  on  page  144. 
8.    When  replacing  a  FRU,  use  the  correct  screw  as 
shown  in  the  procedures.
DANGER
  
 
 
 
Attention:   After  replacing  a  FRU,  do  not  turn  on  the 
computer  until  you  have  made  sure  that  all  screws, 
springs,  and  other  small  parts  are  in  place  and  none  are 
loose  inside  the  computer.  Verify  this  by  shaking  the 
computer  gently  and  listening  for  rattling  sounds.  Metallic 
parts  or  metal  flakes  can  cause  electrical  short  circuits.
 Attention:   The  system  board  is  sensitive  to,  and  can  be 
damaged  by,  electrostatic  discharge.  Before  touching  it, 
establish  personal  grounding  by  touching  a  ground  point 
with  one  hand  or  by  using  an  electrostatic  discharge  (ESD) 
strap  (P/N  6405959).
Before
  removing  any  FRU,  turn  off  the  computer, 
unplug  all  power  cords  from  electrical  outlets, 
remove  the  battery  pack,  and  then  disconnect  any 
interconnecting  cables.
