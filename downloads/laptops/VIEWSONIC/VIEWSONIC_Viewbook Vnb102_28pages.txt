When the computer is running or charging, heat is produced inside the Netbook and transferred 
to the back of the chassis by the heat dissipation system for cooling. The transformer may also 
produce a lot of heat during normal use as well. The Netbook and its transformer should therefore 
not be placed in the lap or on any other body part for prolonged periods during use. Also avoid 
placing the Netbook on a soft surface (e.g. sofa) as it might block the heat vents and interfere 
with cooling.

Setting Up Your Computer
2-1 Installing/Removing the Battery
Please install the battery before using the Netbook and connect the external power supply 
transformer. The Netbook can be powered by the battery or the external transformer. If you are 
in an ofce environment, we recommend using the external transformer as much as possible. 
If you are away from the ofce and no power socket is available, use the battery instead. 
Installing the Battery
Step 1: Turn the Netbook over and have the back of the battery facing upwards as well. Now 
push  the end of the battery with the metal contacts into the Netbook's battery slot 
evenly and slowly along the battery rails. 
Step 2: Push the end of the Netbook battery with the metal contacts completely into the 
battery slot. When there is a "click", this means the battery latch has engaged and 
the battery is now secured to the Netbook. 
Step 3: Push the Battery Lock inwards lightly to lock the battery in place.

Using the Touchpad
3-1 Introduction to the Touchpad
The touchpad is like a computer mouse. It senses the pressure from the user's nger and 
generates a voltage that is used to control the cursor's movements and issue commands. 
The touchpad senses nger movements. Simply move one nger across the touchpad to 
control the movement of the cursor on screen. Below the touchpad is two buttons. The left 
button is like the left mouse button and is used for selecting options or launching programs 
on screen. The right button works the same way as the right mouse button.
Touchpad
Left Button Right Button
3-2 Single Tap/ Single Click 
To select a window function or press a button icon, move your nger across the touchpad to 
move the cursor to the window or button to select. Now tap the touchpad with your nger to 
perform the action. This action is equivalent to pressing the left mouse button. You can also 
press the left touchpad button for the same effect. 
3-3 Double Tap/ Double Click
To open a le or document, move your nger across the touchpad to move the cursor to the 
le you wish to open. Now quickly tap the touchpad twice with your nger to perform the 
action. This action is equivalent to pressing the left mouse button twice. You can also press 
the left touchpad button twice for the same effect. 
3-4 Drag
Move your nger across the touchpad to move the cursor to the object you wish to drag. 
Now hold down the left touchpad button with one hand and move the cursor to the desired 
location. Release the button and complete the drag operation. You can also double tap the 
object you wish to drag and keep the nger on the touchpad after the second tap to perform 
the drag operation with one hand.

You will then receive a FinalConrmation warning to make sure you are aware that all 
the partitions and data will be removed (if you need to back up data/partitions then click 
No to exit and back up any data before running the Recovery DVD again).
If you are sure you want to delete all data and partitions then click Yes.
The tools will load and the recovery process will then begin (note that the keyboard and 
mouse will be temporarily locked during the recovery process).
When the recovery process is complete the computer will restart.
Disconnect the external DVD drive and start up the computer.
You will then need to input your country and region preferences, passwords etc.
A short introductory video will appear before the system personalizes your settings.
When the system recovery is complete you can then restore any backed up data.
