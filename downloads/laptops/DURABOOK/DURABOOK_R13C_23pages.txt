Optical Device 
Your notebook can support the Combo drive or Super Multi drive(It is 
optional). The CD-ROM drive is a read-only drive. It cannot be used to write 
data to a recordable CD. The CD-ROM drive can read data from CDs, 
including audio or video CDs. The CD-RW can perform these same 
functions, as well as record information to writeable CD's. The DVD drive 
can read both DVDs and CDs. Your Tablet PC identifies the drive with the 
letter following the hard drive letter. If your hard drive is D, then the CD-
ROM drive will be E. 
 
Memory 
Adding memory allows the notebook to operate faster, handle more tasks 
simultaneously, and work more smoothly with large files. Users who 
increase memory demands - by adding additional programs, for example - 
may notice a slower operating speed, and may wish to increase memory. 
The notebook includes a memory card slot for adding additional memory.

With Windows 7™, power consumption may be reduced through ‘Power 
plans’.  This  tool controls the interaction between hardware and system 
settings that manage how the computer uses energy, therefore the battery 
life and system performance can be balanced as well as enhanced. 
Checking the Battery Level 
You can check the remaining battery power in the Windows® battery status 
indicator located at the lower right-hand corner of the task tray. The Battery 
Status icon only appears in the task tray while the unit is running on the 
battery power but not while the unit is running off an external power source 
through the AC adaptor. 
 
  Battery Power Indicator  
 
Monitoring Battery Power 
The battery status indicator 
allows you to monitor how 
much power the battery has 
left. 
1.  Left-click on the battery 
status indicator. 
2.  Moving the cursor to

Sleep Power State 
This mode allows the  computer to retain its workload in a minimum
usage of energy as standby. When user returns,  the work can be
easily resumed no matter where it stopped.
 
Advantages of sleep state: 
-  All programs and informations during operation will automatically  
 be saved to the hard-disk. 
-  When using a mobile PC, Windows operating system will restore  
the previous work within seconds, it won’t be necessary to restart 
       or re-open the files.  
      -  While sleeping, only approx. one-tenth the energy will be used 
      comparing when running at full power, and a mobile PC typically 
      uses one to two percent of battery power per hour. 
      To save the energy further, Windows will automatically turn off the 
      computer after a
 period of time based on the Sleep and Hibernation 
      settings within the power plan.

When to Replace the Battery 
Over time, the battery's capacity gradually decreases. We recommend that 
you replace your battery when you notice that it begins to show significantly 
less charge. 
Changing the Battery 
Change the main battery pack as shown below: 
 
         *Slide battery latch to lift the cover, then 
          insert battery into the compartment as 
          illustrated. When the battery has been       
          fully sealed, slide the latch backward to 
          lock the lid up.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            Thermal Considerations 
        The notebook processor has been specially designed to consume  
        less power and generate less heat. However, working in a hot 
        environment, or working for long periods may raise the temperature. If 
        the temperature continues to rise, processor activity will be reduced. 
        You may notice a slight loss of performance when this happens.
