Safety lnstructions
Use the following safety guidelines to help protect yourself and your 
computer.
When Using Your Computer 
■ Do not attempt to service the computer yourself. Always follow 
installation instructions closely.
■ Do not carry a battery in your pocket, purse, or other container where 
metal objects (such as car keys) could short-circuit the battery 
terminals. The resulting excessive current follow can cause extremely 
high temperatures and may result in damage from burns.
Do not operate your portable computer for an extended period of time with 
the base resting directly on your body. With extended operation, heat can 
potentially build up in the base. Allowing sustained contact with the skin 
could cause discomfort or, eventually, a burn.

source. 115V/60 Hz in most of North and South America and some Far 
Eastern countries such as Taiwan. 100 V/50 Hz in eastern Japan and 
100 V/60 Hz in westem Japan. 230 V/50 Hz in most of Europe, the 
Middle East, and the Far East.
■ If you use an extension cable with your AC adapter, ensure that the total 
ampere rating of the products plugged in to the extension cable does 
not exceed the ampere rating of the extension cable.
■ To remove power form the computer, turn it off, remove the battery, and

General Precautions
TOSHIBA computers are designed to optimize safety, minimize strain and 
withstand the rigors of portability. However, certain precautions should be 
observed to further reduce the risk of personal injury or damage to the 
computer.
Be certain to read the general precautions below and to note the cautions 
included in the text of the manual.
Creating a computer-friendly environment
Place the computer on a flat surface that is large enough for the computer 
and any other items you are using, such as a printer.
Leave enough space around the computer and other equipment to provide 
adequate ventilation. Otherwise, they may overheat.
To keep your computer in prime operating condition, protect your work area 
from:
■ Dust, moisture, and direct sunlight.
■ Equipment that generates a strong electromagnetic field, such as 
stereo speakers (other than speakers that are connected to the 
computer) or speakerphones.
■ Rapid changes in temperature or humidity and sources of temperature 
change such as air conditioner vents or heaters.
■ Extreme heat, cold, or humidity.
■ Liquids and corrosive chemicals.
Stress injury
Carefully read the Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort. It contains 
information on the prevention of stress injuries to your hands and wrists 
that can be caused by extensive keyboard use. Chapter 3, Getting Started, 
also includes information on work space design, posture and lighting that 
can help reduce physical stress.

--- Page 18 ---
User’s Manual xviii
P300/P300D Series
Heat injury
■ Avoid prolonged physical contact with the computer. If the computer is 
used for long periods, its surface can become very warm. While the 
temperature will not feel hot to the touch, if you maintain physical 
contact with the computer for a long time, for example if you rest the 
computer on your lap or if you keep your hands on the palm rest, your 
skin might suffer a low-heat injury.
■ If the computer has been used for a long time, avoid direct contact with 
the metal plate supporting the various interface ports as this can 
become hot.
■ The surface of the AC adaptor can become hot when in use but this 
condition does not indicate a malfunction. If you need to transport the 
AC adaptor, you should disconnect it and let it cool before moving it.
■ Do not lay the AC adaptor on a material that is sensitive to heat as the 
material could become damaged.
Pressure or impact damage
Do not apply heavy pressure to the computer or subject it to any form of 
strong impact as this can damage the computer's components or otherwise 
cause it to malfunction.
ExpressCard overheating
Some PC and ExpressCards can become hot during prolonged use which 
may result in errors or instability in the operation of the device in question. 
In addition, you should also be careful when you remove a PC or 
ExpressCard that has been used for a long time.
Mobile phones
Please be aware that the use of mobile phones can interfere with the audio 
system. The operation of the computer will not be impaired in any way, but 
it is recommended that a minimum distance of 30cm is maintained between 
the computer and a mobile phone that is in use.
Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort
All important information on the safe and proper use of this computer is 
described in the enclosed Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort. Be 
sure to read it before using the computer.

Keys
The keyboard keys are used in the text to describe many computer 
operations. A distinctive typeface identifies the key top symbols as they 
appear on the keyboard. For example, Enter identifies the Enter key. 
Key operation
Some operations require you to simultaneously use two or more keys. We 
identify such operations by the key top symbols separated by a plus sign 
(+). For example, Ctrl + C means you must hold down Ctrl and at the same 
time press C. If three keys are used, hold down the first two and at the 
same time press the third.

Introduction
Memory
Slots PC2-5300 (PM965/GM965/RS690M)/PC2-4200 
(GL960) 512 MB, 1024 MB or 2048 MB. Up to 
2 GB memory module can be installed in the 
memory slot for a maximum of 4 GB 
(PM965/GM965/M690G), 2 GB (GL960) system 
memory total, depending on the model you 
purchased.
Main Memory 
Disclaimer
Part of the main system memory may be used by 
the graphics system for graphics performance 
and therefore reduce the amount of main system 
memory available for other computing activities. 
The amount of main system memory allocated to 
support graphics may vary depending on the 
graphics system, applications utilized, system 
memory size and other factors. For PC's 
configured with 4 GB of system memory, the full 
system memory space for computing activities will 
be considerably less and will vary by model and 
system configuration.
If your computer is configured with two 2 GB memory modules, the 
memory might be displayed as approximately 3 GB only (depending on the 
computer's hardware specifications). 
This is correct because the operating system usually displays the available 
memory instead of the physical memory (RAM) built into the computer. 
Various system components (like the video adapter's GPU and PCI 
devices like Wireless LAN, etc.) require their own memory space. Since a 
32-bit operating system cannot address more than 4 GB of memory these 
system resources overlap the physical memory. It is a technical limitation 
that the overlapped memory is not available to the operating system. 
Even though some tools might display the actual physical memory built 
into your computer, the memory available to the operating system will still 
be approximately 3 GB only.

RTC Battery  The internal RTC battery backs up the Real Time 
Clock and calendar. 
AC Adaptor  The universal AC adaptor provides power to the 
system and recharges the batteries when they 
are low. It comes with a detachable power cord. 
Because it is universal, it can receive a range of 
AC voltage from 100 to 240 volts; however, the 
output current varies among different models. 
Using the wrong model can damage your 
computer. Refer to the AC adaptor section in 
Chapter 2, The Grand Tour.

Slide the finger over the recognition sensor
Points to note about the fingerprint sensor
Failure to follow these guidelines might result in (1) damage to the sensor 
or cause sensor failure, (2) finger recognition problems, or lower finger rec-
ognition success rate. 
■ Do not scratch or poke the sensor with your nails or any hard or sharp 
objects.
■ Do not press the sensor strongly.
■ Do not touch the sensor with a wet finger or any wet objects. Keep 
sensor surface dry and free of water vapor.
■ Do not touch the sensor with a soiled finger. Minute foreign particles on 
a soiled or dirty finger may scratch the sensor.
■ Do not paste stickers or write on the sensor.
■ Do not touch the sensor with a finger or any object with built-up static 
electricity.
■ Avoid swiping with the finger stiff or pressed-on too hard:
Fingerprint reading may fail if the center of the fingerprint is not 
touching on the sensor, or when finger is swiped while pressing hard. 
Make sure that the center of the fingerprint is touching the sensor 
before swiping.
■ Confirm the center of the fingerprint whirl before swiping:
The thumb’s fingerprint has a bigger whirl, which is prone to 
misalignment and distortions. This will cause difficulty in registration 
and a drop in the authentication success rate. Always confirm the 
center of the fingerprint whirl so that it is swiped along the centerline of 
the sensor.
■ When fingerprint reading is not successful:
There is a possibility of authentication failures if the finger is swiped too 
quickly or too slowly. Follow the onscreen instructions to adjust the 
speed of the swipe.

Operating Basics
Observe the following before you place your finger on the sensor whether 
for fingerprint enrollment/registration or recognition.
■ Wash and dry your hands thoroughly.
■ Remove static electricity from your fingers by touching any metal 
surface. Static electricity is a common cause of sensor failures, 
especially when the weather is dry.
■ Clean the sensor with a lint-free cloth. Do not use detergent to clean the 
sensor.
■ Avoid the following finger conditions for enrollment or recognition as 
they may result in fingerprint enrollment errors or a drop in the 
fingerprint recognition success rate.
■ Soaked or swollen finger (e.g. after taking bath)
■ Injured finger
■ Wet finger
■ Soiled or oily finger
■ Extremely dry skin condition on finger
Observe the following to improve the fingerprint recognition success rate.
■ Enroll two or more fingers.
■ Enroll additional fingers if recognition failure occurs often using enrolled 
fingers. 
■ Check your finger condition. Changed conditions, such as injured, 
rough, extremely dry, wet, soiled, dirty, oily, soaked, swollen fingers, 
may lower the recognition success rate. Also if the fingerprint is worn 
down or the finger becomes thinner or fatter, the recognition success 
rate may be lowered.
■ The fingerprint for each finger is different and unique. Please ensure 
that only the registered or enrolled fingerprint or fingerprints are used 
for identification.
■ Check sliding position and speed. 
■ Fingerprint data is enrolled up to 30~34.
■ Fingerprint data is stored into the nonvolatile memory in the fingerprint 
sensor. Deleting the fingerprint data with Delete menu on Fingerprint 
Software Management before you dispose the computer is

USB Sleep and Charge function
Your computer can supply USB bus power (DCSV) to the USB port even 
when the power of the computer is turned OFF. "Power OFF" includes 
Sleep Mode, Hibernation Mode or shutdown state.
This function can only be used for ports that support the USB Sleep and 
Charge function (hereinafter called "compatible ports").
Compatible ports are USB ports that have the ( ) symbol icon.
You can use the "USB Sleep and Charge function" to charge certain USB-
compatible external devices such as mobile phones or portable digital 
music players.
However, the "USB Sleep and Charge function" may not work with certain 
external devices even if they are compliant with the USB specification. In 
those cases, turn the power of the computer ON to charge the device.
■ The "USB Sleep and Charge function" only works for compatible ports. 
This function is disabled in the default setting. To enable it, you must 
change [Disabled] to [Enabled] in the HW setup.
■ When "USB Sleep and Charge function" is set to [Enabled] in HW 
Setup, USB bus power (DC5V) will be supplied to compatible ports 
even when the power of the computer is turned "OFF". 
USB bus power (DC5V) is similarly supplied to the external devices 
which are connected to the compatible ports. However, some external 
devices cannot be charged solely by supplying USB bus power 
(DC5V). 
As for the specifications of the external devices, please contact the 
device manufacturer or check the specifications of the external devices 
thoroughly before use. 
■ Using the USB sleep and charge function to charge external devices 
will take longer than charging the devices with their own chargers.
■ If external devices are connected to compatible ports when the AC 
adaptor is not connected to the computer, the battery of the computer 
will be depleted even when the power of the computer is turned OFF. 
As such, we recommend that you connect the AC adaptor to the 
computer when using the USD sleep and charge function.
■ External devices connected to the USB bus power (DC5V) function that 
interfaces with the power ON/OFF of the computer may always be in 
an operational state.
■ When there is a current overflow of the external devices connected to 
the compatible ports, USB bus power (DC5V) supply may be stopped 
for safety reasons.

Using the microphone
Your computer has a built-in microphone that can be used to record 
monaural sounds into your applications. It can also be used to issue voice 
commands to applications that support such functions.(Built-in microphone 
is provided with some models)
Since your computer has a built-in microphone and speaker, "feedback" 
may be heard under certain conditions. Feedback occurs when sound from 
the speaker is picked up in the microphone and amplified back to the 
speaker, which amplifies it again to the microphone.
This feedback occurs repeatedly and causes a very loud, high-pitched 
noise. It is a common phenomenon that occurs in any sound system when 
the microphone input is output to the speaker (throughput) and the speaker 
volume is too loud or too close to the microphone. You can control 
throughput by adjusting the volume of your speaker or through the Mute 
function in the Master Volume panel. Refer to your Windows documentation 
for details on using the Master Volume panel.
Using the optical disc drive
The text and illustrations in this section refer primarily to the optical disc 
drive. However, operation is the same for all other optical media drives. The 
full-size drive provides high-performance execution of CD/DVD-based 
programs. You can run either 12 cm (4.72") or 8 cm (3.15") CDs without an 
adaptor. An ATAPI interface controller is used for CD/DVD operation. When 
the computer is accessing a CD/DVD, an indicator on the drive glows.
Refer also to the Writing CD/DVD with the DVD Super Multi drive or HD 
DVD-ROM drive supporting DVD±R DL section for precautions on writing to 
CD/DVD.

■ If the disc is poor in quality, dirty or damaged, writing or rewriting errors 
may occur. Be careful to check the disc for dirt or damage before you 
use it. 
■ The actual number of rewrites to CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW or 
DVD-RAM is affected by the quality of the disc and the way it is used. 
■ There are two types of DVD-R discs: authoring and general use discs. 
Do not use authoring discs. Only general use discs can be written to by 
a computer drive.
■ We can support only Format1 of DVD-R DL. Therefore you cannot do 
the additional writing. If your data is under 4.7 GB, we suggest to use 
DVD-R (SL) media.
■ You can use DVD-RAM discs that can be removed from a cartridge and 
DVD-RAM discs designed without a cartridge. You can not use a disc 
with a 2.6 GB single-sided capacity and 5.2 GB double-sided capacity.
■ Other DVD-ROM drives for computers or other DVD players may not be 
able to read DVD-R/-RW or DVD+R/+RW discs.
■ Data written to a CD-R/DVD-R/DVD+R disc cannot be deleted either in 
whole or in part.
■ Data deleted (erased) from a CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-
RAM disc cannot be recovered. Check the content of the disc carefully 
before you delete it. If multiple drives that can write data to discs are 
connected, be careful not to delete data from the wrong drive.
■ In writing to a DVD-R/-RW, DVD+R/+RW or DVD-RAM disc, some disc 
space is required for file management, so you may not be able to write 
the full capacity of the disc.
■ Since the disc is based on the DVD standard, it might be filled with 
dummy data if the written data is less than about 1 GB. Even if you write 
only a small amount of data, it might take time to fill in the dummy data.
■ DVD-RAM formatted by FAT32 cannot be read in WindowsR 2000 
without DVD-RAM Driver Software.
■ When multiple drives that can write data to discs are connected, be 
careful not to write to the wrong drive.
■ Be sure to connect the AC adaptor before you write or rewrite.

Operating Basics
■ If the disc is poor in quality, or is dirty or damaged, writing or rewriting 
errors may be noted - ensure that you check all discs for dirt or damage 
before you use them.
■ The actual number of rewrites to CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-
RAM or HD DVD-RW media will be affected by the quality of the disc 
itself and the way in which it is used.
■ There are two types of DVD-R media available, authoring discs and 
general use discs. Do not attempt to use authoring discs as only 
general use discs can be written to by a computer drive.
■ You can use both DVD-RAM discs that can be removed from a cartridge 
and DVD-RAM discs designed without a cartridge.
■ You may find that other computer DVD-ROM drives or other DVD 
players may not be able to read DVD-R, DVD-R (Dual Layer), DVD-RW,

■ In writing to DVD-R, DVD-R (Dual Layer), DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R 
(Double Layer), DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, HD DVD-R, HD DVD-R(Dual 
Layer) or HD DVD-RW media, some space is required for file 
management, so you may not be able to write to the full capacity of the 
disc.
■ Since the disc is based on the DVD standard, it might be filled with 
dummy data if the written data is less than about 1 GB. Therefore, in 
these circumstance, even if you write only a small amount of data, it 
might take additional time to fill in the dummy data.
■ When multiple drives that can write data to discs are connected, be 
sure that you do not write to or delete data from the wrong drive.
■ Be sure to connect the AC adaptor to the computer before you write or 
rewrite any information.
■ Before you enter either Sleep Mode or Hibernation Mode, take care to 
ensure that any DVD-RAM writing has been completed. In this instance, 
writing is finished if you can eject the DVD-RAM media.
■ Be sure to close all other software programs except for the writing 
software itself.
■ Do not run software such as a screen saver which can put a heavy load 
on the processor.
■ Operate the computer at its full power settings - do not use any power-
saving features.

The Keyboard
Chapter 5
The Keyboard 
The number of keys on your keyboard depends on which country/region’s 
keyboard layout your computer is configured with. Keyboards for numerous 
languages are available.
There are five types of keys: typewriter keys, function keys, soft keys, 
Windows
®
 special keys, and cursor control keys. 
Typewriter keys 
The typewriter keys produce the upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, 
punctuation marks, and special symbols that appear on the screen. 
There are some differences, however, between using a typewriter and 
using a computer keyboard: 
■ Letters and numbers produced in computer text vary in width. Spaces, 
which are created by a "space character," may also vary depending on 
line justification and other factors. 
■ The lowercase l (el) and the number 1 (one) are not interchangeable on 
computers as they are on a typewriter. 
■ The uppercase O (oh) and the 0 (zero) are not interchangeable. 
■ The Caps Lock function key locks only the alphabetic characters in 
uppercase while the shift lock on a typewriter places all keys in the 
shifted position. 
■ The Shift keys, the Tab key, and the BackSpace key perform the same 
function as their typewriter counterparts but also have special computer 
functions.

Battery types
The computer has the following batteries: 
■ Battery pack (6cell or 9cell depending on the model.)
■ Real Time Clock (RTC) battery 
Battery pack
When the AC adaptor is not connected, the computer's main power source 
is a removable lithium ion battery pack, also referred to in this manual as 
the main battery. You can purchase additional battery packs for extended 
use of the computer away from an AC power source. 
Before you remove the battery pack, set the computer to Hibernation Mode 
or save your data and shut down the computer. Do not change the battery 
pack while the AC adaptor is connected. 
Battery pack 
To ensure that the battery pack maintains its maximum capacity, operate 
the computer on battery power at least once a month until the battery pack 
is fully discharged. Refer to Extending battery life in this chapter for 
procedures. If the computer is continuously operated on AC power through 
an AC adaptor for an extended period, more than a month, the battery may 
fail to retain a charge. It may not function efficiently over the expected life of 
the battery and the Battery indicator may not indicate a low-battery 
condition. 
■ The battery pack is a lithium ion battery, which can explode if not 
properly replaced, used, handled or disposed of. Dispose of the battery 
as required by local ordinances or regulations. Use only batteries 
recommended by TOSHIBA as replacements. 
■ Do not remove the battery pack while the computer is in Sleep Mode. 
Data is stored in RAM, so if the computer loses power it will be lost. 
When the computer is powered off in Sleep Mode, and the AC adaptor 
is not connected, the main battery pack supplies power to maintain 
data and programs in memory. If the battery pack is completely 
discharged, Sleep Mode does not function and the computer loses all 
data in memory.

Troubleshooting
Chapter 9
Troubleshooting
TOSHIBA designed the computer for durability. However, should problems 
occur, following the procedures in this chapter can help to determine the 
cause. 
All readers should become familiar with this chapter. Knowing what might 
go wrong can help prevent problems from occurring. 
Problem solving process 
Resolving problems will be much easier if you observe the following 
guidelines: 
■ Stop immediately when you recognize a problem exists. Further action 
may result in data loss or damage. You may destroy valuable problem 
related information that can help solve the problem. 
■ Observe what is happening. Write down what the system is doing and 
what actions you performed immediately before the problem occurred. 
If you have a printer attached, print a copy of the screen using PrtSc. 
The questions and procedures offered in this chapter are meant as a guide, 
they are not definitive problem solving techniques. Many problems can be 
solved simply, but a few may require help from your dealer. If you find you 
need to consult your dealer or others, be prepared to describe the problem 
in as much detail as possible. 
Preliminary checklist 
Consider the simplest solution first. The items in this checklist are easy to 
fix and yet can cause what appears to be a serious problem. 
■ Make sure you turn on all peripheral devices before you turn on the 
computer. This includes your printer and any other external device you 
are using. 
■ Before you attach an external device, turn the computer off. When you 
turn the computer back on it recognizes the new device. 
■ Make sure all options are set properly in the setup program. 
■ Check all cables. Are they correctly and firmly attached? Loose cables 
can cause signal errors.

--- Page 147 ---
User’s Manual 9-2
Troubleshooting
■ Inspect all connecting cables for loose wires and all connectors for 
loose pins. 
■ Check that your CD/DVD/CD-RW/HD DVD-R is correctly inserted.
Make notes of your observations and keep them in a permanent error log. 
This will help you describe your problems to your dealer. If a problem 
recurs, the log will help you identify the problem faster. 
Analyzing the problem 
Sometimes the system gives clues that can help you identify why it is 
malfunctioning. Keep the following questions in mind: 
■ Which part of the system is not operating properly: keyboard, hard disk 
drive, optical media drive, display. Each device produces different 
symptoms. 
■ Is the operating system configuration set properly? Check the 
configuration options. 
■ What appears on the display screen? Does it display any messages or 
random characters? Print a copy of the screen if you have a printer 
attached. Look up the messages in the software and operating system 
documentation. Check that all connecting cables are correctly and 
firmly attached. Loose cables can cause erroneous or intermittent 
signals. 
■ Do any indicators light? Which ones? What color are they? Do they stay 
on or blink? Write down what you see. 
■ Do you hear any beeps? How many? Are they long or short? Are they 
high pitched or low? Is the computer making any unusual noises? Write 
down what you hear. 
Record your observations so you can describe them to your dealer. 
Software The problems may be caused by your software or 
disc. If you cannot load a software package, the 
media may be damaged or the program might be 
corrupted. Try loading another copy of the 
software. 
If an error message appears while you are using a 
software package, check the software 
documentation. These documents usually include 
a problem solving section or a summary of error 
messages. 
Next, check any error messages in the operating 
system documentation. 
Hardware If you cannot find a software problem, check your 
hardware. 
First run through the items in the preliminary 
checklist above. If you still cannot correct the 
problem, try to identify the source. The next 
section provides checklists for individual 
components and peripherals.

Check whether the battery is hot or cold to the 
touch. If the battery is too hot or too cold, it will 
not charge properly. Let it reach room 
temperature. 
Unplug the AC adaptor and remove the battery to 
make sure the terminals are clean. If necessary 
wipe them with a soft dry cloth dipped in alcohol. 
Connect the AC adaptor and replace the battery. 
Make sure it is securely seated. 
Check the Battery indicator. If it does not glow, 
let the computer charge the battery for at least 
20 minutes. If the Battery indicator glows after 
20 minutes, let the battery continue to charge at 
least another 20 minutes before turning on the 
computer. 
If the indicator still does not glow, the battery may 
be at the end of its operating life. Replace it. 
If you do not think the battery is at the end of its 
operating life, see your dealer. 
Battery doesn't power 
the computer as long as 
expected 
If you frequently recharge a partially charged 
battery, the battery might not charge to its full 
potential. Fully discharge the battery, then try to 
charge it again. 
Check the power consumption settings in the 
Power Options. Consider using a power saving 
feature.

USB Sleep and Charge function
Problem  Procedure
I cannot use the "USB 
Sleep and Charge 
function".
The setting of "USB Sleep and Charge function" 
may be [Disabled]. Change the setting to 
[Enabled] in the HW Setup.
When there is a current overflow of the external 
device connected to the compatible port, USB 
bus power (DC5V) supply may be stopped for 
safety reasons. When the happens, disconnect 
an external device if some external devices are 
connected. After that, turn the power of the 
computer ON/OFF to restore the function. If this 
function can not be still used even if only one 
external device is connected, stop using the 
external device because its current is over the 
acceptable value of this computer.
Some external devices may not be able to use 
the "USB Sleep and Charge function." In this 
case, please try one or more of the following 
methods.
■ Change a mode setting of [Enabled] by the 
HW Setup.
■ Turn OFF the computer while external 
devices are connected.
If this function can not be still used, change the 
setting to [Disabled] in the BIOS Setup and stop 
using the function.
The battery depletes 
quickly even when I 
have turned OFF to the 
power of the computer.
When "USB Sleep and Charge function" is set to 
[Enabled] in the HW Setup, USB bus power 
(DC5V) will be supplied to the external device 
connected to the compatible port. If external 
device is connected to the compatible port when 
the AC adaptor is not connected to the computer, 
the battery of the computer will be depleted even 
when the power of the computer is turned OFF.
Connect the AC adaptor to the computer or 
change the "USB Sleep and Charge function" 
setting the [Disabled] in the HW Setup.
Instead use a USB Port that does not have the 
USB Sleep and Charge function-compatible icon 
().

Radio Characteristics 
Radio Characteristics of Wireless LAN Cards may vary according to: 
■ Country/region where the product was purchased 
■ Type of product 
Wireless communication is often subject to local radio regulations. 
Although Wireless LAN wireless networking products have been designed 
for operation in the license-free 2.4GHz and 5GHz band, local radio 
regulations may impose a number of limitations to the use of wireless 
communication equipment. 
The range of the wireless signal is related to the transmit rate of the 
wireless communication device. Communications at a lower transmission 
rate may travel larger distances. 
■ The range of your wireless devices can be affected when the antennas 
are placed near metal surfaces and solid high-density materials. 
■ Range is also impacted due to "obstacles" in the path of the 
transmission that may either absorb or reflect the radio signal.
Refer to the sheet "Information to the User" for regulatory information that 
may apply in your country/region. 
R-F Frequency ■ Band 2.4 GHz (2400~2497 MHz) for

64-bit computing requires that the following hardware and software 
requirements are met:
■ 64-bit Operating System
■ 64-bit CPU, Chipset and BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
■ 64-bit Device drivers
■ 64-bit applications
Certain device drivers and/or applications may not be compatible with a 64-
bit CPU and therefore may not function properly. A 32-bit version of the 
operating system is preinstalled on your computer unless explicitly stated 
that the operating system is 64-bit.
Memory (Main System)
Part of the main system memory may be used by the graphics system for 
graphics performance and therefore reduce the amount of main system 
memory available for other computing activities. The amount of main 
system memory allocated to support graphics may vary depending on the 
graphics system, applications utilized, system memory size and other 
factors. For computer's configured with 4 GB of system memory, the full 
system memory space for computing activities will be considerably less and 
will vary by model and system configuration.
Battery Life
Battery life may vary considerably depending on product model, 
configuration, applications, power management settings and features 
utilized, as well as the natural performance variations produced by the 
design of individual components. Published battery life numbers are 
achieved on select models and configurations tested by TOSHIBA at the 
time of publication. Recharge time varies depending on usage. Battery may 
not charge while computer is consuming full power.

--- Page 177 ---
User’s Manual E-3
Legal Footnotes
After going through many charge and discharge cycles, the battery will lose 
its ability to perform at maximum capacity and will need to be replaced. 
This is a normal phenomenon for all batteries. To purchase a new battery 
pack, see the accessories information that is shipped with your computer.
Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Capacity
1 Gigabyte (GB) means 10
9
 = 1,000,000,000 bytes using powers of 10. The 
computer operating system, however, reports storage capacity using 
powers of 2 for the definition of 1 GB = 2
30
 = 1,073,741,824 bytes, and 
therefore shows less storage capacity. Available storage capacity will also 
be less if the product includes one or more pre-installed operating systems, 
such as Microsoft Windows and/or pre-installed software applications, or 
media content. Actual formatted capacity may vary.
LCD
Over a period of time, and depending on the usage of the computer, the 
brightness of the LCD screen will deteriorate. This is an intrinsic 
characteristic of LCD technology.
Maximum brightness is only available when operating in AC power mode. 
The screen will dim when the computer is operated on battery power and 
you may not be able to increase the brightness of the screen.
Graphics Processor Unit ("GPU")
Graphics processor unit ("GPU") performance may vary depending on 
product model, design configuration, applications, power management 
settings and features utilized. GPU performance is only optimized when 
operating in AC power mode and may decrease considerably when 
operating in battery power mode.
Wireless LAN
The transmission speed over the wireless LAN and the distance over which 
wireless LAN can reach may vary depending on surrounding 
electromagnetic environment, obstacles, access point design and 
configuration, and client design and software/hardware configurations.
[54Mbps is the theoretical maximum speed under the IEEE802.11 (a/b/g) 
standard.] The actual transmission speed will be lower than the theoretical 
maximum speed.
