Introduction
============
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of
them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools
and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not
fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType
font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very
least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG
Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in
commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main
points are that:
We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form,
without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only
parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your
documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')
We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or
without modifications, in commercial products.
We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no
liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to
use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the
following text:
"""
Portions of this software are copyright (C) <year> The FreeType Project
www.freetype.org
All rights reserved.
"""
Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
actually use.
Legal Terms

ENERGY STAR
®
 Program
Your Computer model may be ENERGY STAR
®
compliant. If the model you purchased is compliant, it is
labeled with the ENERGY STAR logo on the computer and
the following information applies.
TOSHIBA is a partner in the ENERGY STAR Program and
has designed this computer to meet the latest ENERGY
STAR guidelines for energy efficiency. Your computer
ships with the power management options preset to a
configuration that will provide the most stable operating
environment and optimum system performance for both
AC power and battery modes.
To conserve energy, your computer is set to enter the low-
power Sleep Mode which shuts down the system and
display within 15 minutes of inactivity in AC power mode.
TOSHIBA recommends that you leave this and other
energy saving features active, so that your computer will
operate at its maximum energy efficiency. You can wake
the computer from Sleep Mode by pressing the power
button.
Your ENERGY STAR certified computer should be set by
default to enter a low-power "sleep mode" after a period of
inactivity. Simply touching the mouse or keyboard "wakes"
the computer in seconds. These sleep features can save
you up to $23 per year (200 kWh per year in electricity)
and prevent up to 300 pounds of greenhouse gas
emissions annually.To learn how to adjust or activate
these sleep settings on your computer, please go to:
www.energystar.gov/sleepinstructions
To activate sleep settings organization-wide quickly and
easily through network tools, please go to

chance of developing a painful or disabling injury to your hand, arms,
shoulders or neck.
This section provides basic information to start using your computer. It
covers the following topics:
Connecting the AC adaptor
Opening the display
Turning on the power
Initial setup
Use a virus-check program and make sure it is updated regularly.
Never format storage media without checking its content - formatting
destroys all stored data.
It is a good idea to periodically back up the internal Hard Disk Drive or
other main storage device to external media. General storage media is
not durable or stable over long periods of time and under certain
conditions may result in data loss.
Before you install a device or application, save any data in memory to
the Hard Disk Drive or other storage media. Failure to do so may
result in the loss of data.
Connecting the AC adaptor
Attach the AC adaptor when you need to charge the battery or you want to
operate from AC power. It is also the fastest way to get started, because
the battery pack will need to be charged before you can operate from
battery power.
The AC adaptor can automatically adjust to any voltage ranging from 100
to 240 volts and to a frequency of either 50 or 60 hertz, enabling you to use
this computer in almost any country/region. The adaptor converts AC
power to DC power and reduces the voltage supplied to this computer.
Always use the TOSHIBA AC adaptor that was included with your
computer, or use AC adaptors specified by TOSHIBA to avoid any risk
of fire or other damage to the computer. Use of an incompatible AC
adaptor could cause fire or damage to the computer possibly resulting
in serious injury. TOSHIBA assumes no liability for any damage
caused by use of an incompatible adaptor.
Never plug the AC adaptor into a power source that does not
correspond to both the voltage and the frequency specified on the
regulatory label of the unit. Failure to do so could result in a fire or
electric shock, possibly resulting in serious injury.
User's Manual 2-3

--- Page 25 ---
Always use or purchase power cables that comply with the legal
voltage and frequency specifications and requirements in the country
of use. Failure to do so could result in a fire or electric shock, possibly
resulting in serious injury.
The supplied power cord conforms to safety rules and regulations in
the region the computer is bought and should not be used outside this
region. For use in other regions, please buy power cords that conform
to safety rules and regulations in the particular region.
Do not use a 3-pin to 2-pin conversion plug.
When you connect the AC adaptor to the computer, always follow the
steps in the exact order as described in this User’s Manual.
Connecting the power cable to a live electrical outlet should be the last
step otherwise the adaptor DC output plug could hold an electrical
charge and cause an electrical shock or minor bodily injury when
touched. As a general safety precaution, avoid touching any metal
parts.
Never place your computer or AC adaptor on a wooden surface,
furniture, or any other surface that could be marred by exposure to
heat since the computer base and AC adaptor's surface increase in
temperature during normal use.
Always place your computer or AC adaptor on a flat and hard surface
that is resistant to heat damage.
Refer to the enclosed Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort for
detailed precautions and handling instructions.

apply a 3D effect to your own 2D videos. However, note that this
function does not provide the same video content as a video originally
provided in 3D, and does not create a new video in the 3D format but
only plays 2D videos in a 3D like mode.
The picture generated by 2Dto3D conversion function is not the same
as a picture produced for 3D playback use. The 2Dto3D conversion
function simply uses TOSHIBA's original algorithm to apply pseudo 3D
effect to the 2D content.
The Player is set by default in the 2D format. By pressing the 2Dto3D
conversion function button, you decide to activate the 2Dto3D
conversion function and therefore decide to watch your 2D content in

potential copyright infringement and confirm you have any necessary
authorization.
The Player is intended for playing DVD-Video, DVD-VR and video files
and for viewing 2D home video content and other 2D content created
by you in 3D. The 3D playback of any video content not created by the
user may require the direct or indirect permission of third parties,
where such content is protected by copyright, unless otherwise
permitted under applicable law. The protection of intellectual property
rights is essential for TOSHIBA. In this respect, TOSHIBA underlines
that the Player should not be used in a manner infringing such rights.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not infringe any
applicable intellectual property laws when you decide to use the
Player and, more specifically, when you decide to activate the 2Dto3D
conversion function of the Player.

Battery pack
When the AC adaptor is not connected, the computer's main power source
is this lithium ion battery pack, also referred to in this manual as the main
battery.
Real Time Clock (RTC) function
The Real Time Clock (RTC) function is supported. The main battery
provides power for the internal real time clock and calendar function and
User's Manual
4-19

--- Page 69 ---
also maintains the system configuration while the computer is turned off. If
the RTC lasting time completely runs out, the system will lose this
information and the real time clock and calendar will stop working.
You can change the Real Time Clock settings in the BIOS setup utility.
Please refer to Troubleshooting for further information.
Care and use of the battery pack
This section provides the important safety precautions in order to handle
your battery pack properly.
Refer to the enclosed Instruction Manual for Safety and Comfort for
detailed precautions and handling instructions.
Charge the battery pack only in an ambient temperature between 5 and 35
degrees Celsius. Otherwise, the electrolyte solution might leak, battery
pack performance might deteriorate and the battery life might be
shortened.
Charging the batteries
When the power in the battery pack becomes low, the DC IN/Battery
indicator will flash amber to indicate that only a few minutes of battery
power remain. If you continue to use the computer while the DC IN/Battery
indicator flashes, the computer will enable Hibernation Mode so that you do
not lose any data, and automatically turn itself off.
You must recharge a battery pack when it becomes discharged.
Procedures
To recharge a battery pack, connect the AC adaptor to the DC IN 19V jack
and plug the other end into a working outlet - the DC IN/Battery indicator
will glow amber while the battery is being charged.
Charging Time
The following table shows the approximate time required to fully charge a
discharged battery.
Battery type Power off Power on
Battery pack (32Wh, 4
cell)
about 3 hours about 3 hours
Battery pack (45Wh, 4
cell)
about 3 hours about 3 hours
User's Manual 4-20

--- Page 70 ---
Please be aware that the charging time when the computer is on is affected
by ambient temperature, the temperature of the computer and how you are
using the computer - if you make heavy use of external devices for
example, the battery might scarcely charge at all during operation.
Battery charging notice
The battery may not begin charging immediately under the following
conditions:
The battery is extremely hot or cold (if the battery is extremely hot, it
might not charge at all). To ensure the battery charges to its full
capacity, you should charge it at room temperature of between 5°C to
35°C (41°F to 95°F).
The battery is nearly completely discharged. In this instance you
should leave the AC adaptor connected for a few minutes and the
battery should begin charging.
The DC IN/Battery indicator may show a rapid decrease in battery
operating time when you try to charge a battery under the following
conditions:
The battery has not been used for a long time.
The battery has completely discharged and been left in the computer
for a long time.
In such cases you should follow the steps as detailed below:
1. Fully discharge the battery by leaving it in the computer with the power
on until the system automatically turns itself off.
2. Connect the AC adaptor to the DC IN 19V jack of the computer, and to
a wall outlet that is supplying power.
3. Charge the battery until the DC IN/Battery indicator glows white.
Repeat these steps two or three times until the battery recovers normal
capacity.
Monitoring battery capacity
Remaining battery power can be monitored using the following methods.
Clicking the battery icon on the Windows Taskbar
Via the Battery Status in the Windows Mobility Center window
You should wait at least 16 seconds after turning on the computer
before trying to monitor the remaining operating time. This is because
the computer needs this time to check the battery's remaining capacity
and then calculate the remaining operating time, based on this
together with the current power consumption.
Please be aware that the actual remaining operating time may differ
slightly from the calculated time.
User's Manual 4-21

--- Page 71 ---
With repeated discharges and recharges, the battery's capacity will
gradually decrease. In view of this it will be noted that an often used,
older battery will not operate for as long as a new battery even when
both are fully charged.
Maximizing battery operating time
A battery's usefulness depends on how long it can supply power on a
single charge, while how long the charge lasts in a battery depends on:
Processor speed
Screen brightness
System Sleep Mode
System Hibernation Mode
Display power off period
Hard Disk Drive power off period
How often and for how long you use the Hard Disk Drive and external
disk drives, for example, optical disc.
How much charge the battery contained to begin with.
How you use optional devices, such as a USB device, to which the
battery supplies power.
Whether you enable Sleep Mode, which can conserve battery power if
you are frequently turning the computer off and on.
Where you store your programs and data.
Whether you close the display panel when you are not using the
keyboard - closing the display saves power.
The environmental temperature - operating time decreases at low
temperatures.
Whether you enable Sleep and Charge function.
Batteries exhausted time
When you turn off the power of your computer with batteries fully charged,
the batteries will be exhausted within the following approximate period.
Battery type Sleep Mode Shut Down Mode
Battery pack (32Wh, 4
cell)
about 3 days about 35 days
Battery pack (45Wh, 4
cell)
about 3.5 days about 50 days

doing so, follow the steps as detailed below.
1. Turn off the computer's power.
2. Disconnect the AC adaptor and turn on the computer's power - if it
does not turn on then go to Step 4.
3. Operate the computer on battery power for five minutes. If you find
that the battery pack has at least five minutes of operating time,
continue operating until the battery pack is fully discharged, however, if
the DC IN/Battery indicator flashes or there is some other warning to
indicate a low battery condition, go to Step 4.
4. Connect the AC adaptor to the DC IN 19V jack of the computer, and
to a wall outlet that is supplying power. The DC IN/Battery indicator
should glow amber to indicate that the battery pack is being charged,
however, in the event that DC IN/Battery indicator does not glow this
indicates that power is not being supplied - check the connections for
the AC adaptor and the power cord.
5. Charge the battery pack until the DC IN/Battery indicator glows
white.

TOSHIBA PC Health Monitor
The TOSHIBA PC Health Monitor application proactively monitors a
number of system functions such as power consumption, battery health (for
models with battery) and the system cooling, informing you of significant
system conditions. This application recognizes the system and individual
component serial numbers, and will track specific activities related to the
computer and their usage.
The collected information includes device operation time and number of
actuations or status changes (i.e.: number of power button and FN key
combination uses, AC adaptor, battery (for models with battery), LCD, fan
(for models with fan), HDD/SSD, sound volume, wireless communication
functionalities and USB information), date of initial system use, and also
computer and device usage (i.e.: power settings, battery temperature and
recharging (for models with battery), CPU, memory, backlight illumination
time, and temperatures for various devices). The collected information is
not limited to the examples specified here. The stored data uses a very
small portion of the total hard disk capacity, approximately 10MB or less
per year.
This information is used to identify and provide a notification of system
conditions which may effect the performance of your TOSHIBA computer. It
may also be used to help diagnose problems should the computer require
service by TOSHIBA or TOSHIBA's authorized service providers.
Additionally, TOSHIBA may also use this information for quality assurance
analysis.
Subject to the use restrictions above, the data on the internal storage drive
logged may be transferred to entities located outside of your country or
region of residence (e.g., European Union). Those countries may or may
not have the same data protection laws or data protection levels as
required by your home country or region.
You may disable the TOSHIBA PC Health Monitor at any time by
uninstalling the software via Uninstall a program in the Control Panel.
Doing so will automatically delete all collected information from the internal
storage drive.

Chapter 6
Troubleshooting
TOSHIBA has designed this computer for durability, however, should
problems occur you are able to use the procedures detailed in this chapter
to help determine the cause.
All users should become familiar with this chapter as knowing what might
go wrong can help prevent problems from occurring in the first place.
Problem solving process
Resolving problems will be much easier if you observe the following
guidelines:
Stop immediately when you recognize a problem exists as taking
further action may result in data loss or damage, or you may destroy
valuable problem related information that can help solve the problem.
Observe what is happening - write down what the system is doing and
what actions you performed immediately before the problem occurred.
Make a screenshot of the current display.
Please also be aware that the questions and procedures described in this
chapter are meant only as a guide, they are not definitive problem solving
techniques. In reality many problems can be solved simply, but a few may
require help from TOSHIBA Support - if you find you need to consult
others, be prepared to describe the problem in as much detail as possible.
Preliminary checklist
You should always consider the simplest solution first - the items detailed
in this checklist are easy to fix and yet can cause what appears to be a
serious problem:
Make sure you turn on all peripheral devices before you turn on the
computer - this includes your printer and any other external device you
are using.
Before you attach an external device you should first turn the
computer off, then when you turn the computer back on again it will
recognize the new device.
Make sure all optional accessories are configured properly in the
computer's setup program and that all required driver software has
been loaded (please refer to the documentation included with the
optional accessories for further information on its installation and
configuration).
User's Manual
6-1

--- Page 108 ---
Check all cables to ensure they are correctly and firmly attached to the
computer - loose cables can cause signal errors.
Inspect all connecting cables for loose wires and all connectors for
loose pins.
Check that your disc media is correctly loaded
Always try to make detailed notes of your observations and keep them in a
permanent error log - this will help you to describe your problems to
TOSHIBA Support. In addition, if a problem recurs, the log you have made
will help to identify the problem faster.
Analyzing the problem
Sometimes the computer will give you clues that can help you identify why
it is malfunctioning. In view of this you should keep the following questions
in mind:
Which part of the computer is not operating properly - keyboard, Hard
Disk Drive, display panel, Touch Pad, Touch Pad control buttons - as
each device will produce different symptoms.
Check the options within the operating system to ensure that its
configuration is set properly.
What appears on the display? Does it display any messages or
random characters? Make a screenshot of the current display and, if
possible, look up the messages in the documentation included with the
computer, software or operating system.
Check that all connecting cables are correctly and firmly attached as
loose cables can cause erroneous or intermittent signals.
Do any indicators light, if so, which ones, what color are they and do
they stay on or blink? Write down what you see.
Do you hear any beeps, if so how many, are they long or short and are
they high pitched or low pitched? In addition, is the computer making
any unusual noises? Write down what you hear.
Record your observations so you can describe them in detail to TOSHIBA
Support.
Software The problems may be caused by your software
or disk. If you cannot load a software package,
the media may be damaged or the program
might be corrupted - in these instances try
loading another copy of the software if possible.
If an error message appears while you are using
a software package you should refer to the
documentation supplied with it as this will usually
include a problem solving section or a summary
of error messages.
Next, you should check any error messages
against the operating system documentation.
User's Manual 6-2

Hardware If you cannot find a software problem, you should
then check the setup and configuration of your
hardware. First run through the items in the
preliminary checklist as described previously
then, if you still cannot correct the problem, try to
identify the source - the next section provides
checklists for individual components and
peripherals.
Before using a peripheral device or application software that is not an
authorized TOSHIBA part or product, make sure the device or software can
be used with your computer. Use of incompatible devices may cause injury

Wireless Devices and your health
Wireless products, like other radio devices, emit radio frequency
electromagnetic energy. The level of energy emitted by Wireless products
however is far much less than the electromagnetic energy emitted by
wireless devices like for example mobile phones.
Because Wireless products operate within the guidelines found in radio
frequency safety standards and recommendations, TOSHIBA believes
Wireless products are safe for use by consumers. These standards and
recommendations reflect the consensus of the scientific community and
result from deliberations of panels and committees of scientists who
continually review and interpret the extensive research literature.
In some situations or environments, the use of Wireless products may be
restricted by the proprietor of the building or responsible representatives of
the organization. These situations may for example include:
Using the Wireless products equipment on board of airplanes, or
In any other environment where the risk of interference to other
devices or services is perceived or identified as harmful.
If you are uncertain of the policy that applies on the use of wireless devices
in a specific organization or environment (e.g. airports), you are
encouraged to ask for authorization to use the Wireless device prior to
turning on the equipment.
Wireless LAN Technology
The computer’s wireless communication function supports some wireless
communication devices.
Only some models are equipped with both Wireless LAN and Bluetooth
functions.
User's Manual
7-5

--- Page 127 ---
Do not use the Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) or Bluetooth functionalities near a
microwave oven or in areas subject to radio interference or magnetic
fields. Interference from a microwave oven or other source can disrupt
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth operation.
Turn all wireless functionalities off when near a person who may have
a cardiac pacemaker implant or other medical electric device. Radio
waves may affect pacemaker or medical device operation, possibly
resulting in serious injury. Follow the instruction for your medical
device when using any wireless functionality.
Always turn off wireless functionality if the computer is near automatic
control equipment or appliances such as automatic doors or fire
detectors. Radio waves can cause malfunction of such equipment,
possibly resulting in serious injury.
It may not be possible to make a network connection to a specified
network name using the ad hoc network function. If this occurs, the
new network (*) will have to be configured for all computers connected
to the same network in order to re-enable network connections.
* Please be sure to use new network name.
Security
TOSHIBA strongly recommend that you enable encryption
functionality, otherwise your computer will be open to illegal access by
an outsider using a wireless connection. If this occurs, the outsider
may illegally access your system, eavesdrop, or cause the loss or
destruction of stored data.
TOSHIBA is not liable for the loss of data due to eavesdropping or
illegal access through the wireless LAN and the damage thereof.

regulations may impose a number of limitations to the use of wireless
communication equipment.
Radio Frequency Band 5GHz (5150-5850 MHz) (Revision a
and n)
Band 2.4GHz (2400-2483.5 MHz) (Revision
b/g and n)
The range of the wireless signal is related to the transmit rate of the
wireless communication. Communications at lower transmit range may
travel larger distances.
The range of your wireless devices can be affected when the
antennas are placed near metal surfaces and solid high-density
materials.
Range is also impacted due to "obstacles" in the signal path of the
radio that may either absorb or reflect the radio signal.
Radio Frequency Interference Requirements
This device is restricted to indoor use due to its operation in the 5.15 to
5.25GHz frequency range.
High-power radars are allocated as primary users (i.e. priority users) of the
bands 5.25 to 5.35GHz and 5.65 to 5.85GHz and that these radars could
cause interference and/or damage to LE-LAN devices.
Bluetooth wireless technology
Some computers in this series have Bluetooth wireless communication
function which eliminates the need for cables between electronic devices
such as computers, printers and mobile phones. When it is enabled,
Bluetooth provides the wireless personal area network environment which
is safe and trustworthy, that is quick and easy.
You cannot use the computer's built-in Bluetooth functions and an external
Bluetooth adaptor simultaneously. For reference, Bluetooth wireless
technology has the following features:
Security
Two advanced security mechanisms ensure a high level of security:
Authentication prevents access to critical data and makes it impossible
to falsify the origin of a message.
Encryption prevents eavesdropping and maintains link privacy.
Worldwide operation
The Bluetooth radio transmitter and receiver operate in the 2.4GHz band,
which is license-free and compatible with radio systems in most countries
in the world.

CPU
Central Processing Unit (CPU) Performance Legal Footnotes.
CPU performance in your computer product may vary from specifications
under the following conditions:
use of certain external peripheral products
use of battery power instead of AC power
use of certain multimedia, computer generated graphics or video
applications
use of standard telephone lines or low speed network connections
use of complex modeling software, such as high end computer aided
design applications
use of several applications or functionalities simultaneously
use of computer in areas with low air pressure (high altitude >1,000
meters or >3,280 feet above sea level)
User's Manual

use of computer at temperatures outside the range of 5°C to 30°C
(41°F to 86°F) or >25°C (77°F) at high altitude (all temperature
references are approximate and may vary depending on the specific
computer model - contact TOSHIBA support for details).
CPU performance may also vary from specifications due to design
configuration.
Under some conditions, your computer product may automatically shut-
down. This is a normal protective feature designed to reduce the risk of lost
data or damage to the product when used outside recommended
conditions. To avoid risk of lost data, always make back-up copies of data
by periodically storing it on an external storage medium. For optimum
performance, use your computer product only under recommended
conditions. Read additional restrictions in your product documentation.
Contact TOSHIBA technical service and support, refer to TOSHIBA support
section for more information.
64-Bit Computing
Certain 32-bit device drivers and/or applications may not be compatible
with a 64-bit CPU/operating system and therefore may not function
properly.
Memory (Main System)
Part of the main system memory may be used by the graphics system for
graphics performance and therefore reduce the amount of main system
memory available for other computing activities. The amount of main
system memory allocated to support graphics may vary depending on the
graphics system, applications utilized, system memory size and other
factors.
If your computer is configured with more than 3 GB memory, the memory
might be displayed as approximately 3 GB only (depending on the
computer’s hardware specifications).
This is correct because the operating system usually displays the available
memory instead of the physical memory (RAM) built into the computer.
Various system components (like the video adapter’s GPU and PCI
devices like Wireless LAN, etc.) require their own memory space. Since a
32-bit operating system cannot address more than 4 GB of memory, these
system resources overlap the physical memory. It is a technical limitation
that the overlapped memory is not available to the operating system. Even
though some tools might display the actual physical memory built into your
computer, the memory available to the operating system will still be
approximately 3 GB only.
Computers configured with a 64-bit operating system can address 4 GB or
more of system memory.

Battery Life
Battery life may vary considerably depending on product model,
configuration, applications, power management settings and features
utilized, as well as the natural performance variations produced by the
design of individual components. Published battery life numbers are
achieved on select models and configurations tested by TOSHIBA at the
time of publication. Recharge time varies depending on usage. Battery may
not charge while computer is consuming full power.
After going through many charge and discharge cycles, the battery will lose
its ability to perform at maximum capacity and will need to be replaced.
This is a normal phenomenon for all batteries. To purchase a new battery
pack, see the accessories information that is shipped with your computer.
Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Capacity
1 Gigabyte (GB) means 10
9
 = 1,000,000,000 bytes using powers of 10.
The computer operating system, however, reports storage capacity using
powers of 2 for the definition of 1 GB = 2
30
 = 1,073,741,824 bytes, and
therefore shows less storage capacity. Available storage capacity will also
be less if the product includes one or more pre-installed operating systems,
such as Microsoft Operating System and/or pre-installed software
applications, or media content. Actual formatted capacity may vary.
LCD
Over a period of time, and depending on the usage of the computer, the
brightness of the LCD screen will deteriorate. This is an intrinsic
characteristic of LCD technology.
Maximum brightness is only available when operating in AC power mode.
Screen will dim when the computer is operated on battery power and you
may not be able to increase the brightness of the screen.
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
Graphics processing unit (GPU) performance may vary depending on
product model, design configuration, applications, power management
settings and features utilized. GPU performance is only optimized when
operating in AC power mode and may decrease considerably when
operating in battery power mode.
Total Available Graphics Memory is the total of, as applicable, Dedicated
Video Memory, System Video Memory and Shared System Memory.
Shared System Memory will vary depending on system memory size and
other factors.
Wireless LAN
The transmission speed over the wireless LAN and the distance over which
wireless LAN can reach may vary depending on surrounding
User's Manual

electromagnetic environment, obstacles, access point design and
configuration, and client design and software/hardware configurations.
The actual transmission speed will be lower than the theoretical maximum
speed.
Copy Protection
Applicable copy protection standards included in certain media may
prevent or limit recording or viewing of the media.
