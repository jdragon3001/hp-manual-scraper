                                           A02-0604JP
Pursuant to FCC CFR 47, Part 68:
When you are ready to install or use the modem, call your local telephone company
and give them the following information:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The telephone number of the line to which you will connect the modem
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The registration number that is located on the device
The FCC registration number of the modem will be found on either the device which
is to be installed, or, if already installed, on the bottom of the computer outside of the
main system label.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) of the modem, which can vary. For the
REN of your modem, refer to your modem’s label.
The modem connects to the telephone line by means of a standard jack called the
USOC  RJ11C.
Type of service
Your modem is designed to be used on standard-device telephone lines.  Connection
to telephone company-provided coin service (central office implemented systems) is
prohibited. Connection to party lines service is subject to state tariffs. If you have
any questions about your telephone line, such as how many pieces of equipment you
can connect to it, the telephone company will provide this information upon request.

--- Page 7 ---
Telephone company procedures
The goal of the telephone company is to provide you with the best service it can. In
order to do this, it may occasionally be necessary for them to make changes in their
equipment, operations, or procedures. If these changes might affect your service or
the operation of your equipment, the telephone company will give you notice in
writing to allow you to make any changes necessary to maintain uninterrupted
service.
If problems arise
If any of your telephone equipment is not operating properly, you should immedi-
ately remove it from your telephone line, as it may cause harm to the telephone
network. If the telephone company notes a problem, they may temporarily discon-
tinue service. When practical, they will notify you in advance of this disconnection.
If advance notice is not feasible, you will be notified as soon as possible. When
you are notified, you will be given the opportunity to correct the problem and
informed of your right to file a complaint with the FCC. In the event repairs are ever
needed on your modem, they should be performed by TOSHIBA Corporation or an
authorized representative of TOSHIBA Corporation.
Disconnection
If you should ever decide to permanently disconnect your modem from its present
line, please call the telephone company and let them know of this change.
Fax branding
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 makes it unlawful for any person
to use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a telephone
fax machine unless such message clearly contains in a margin at the top or bottom
of each transmitted page or on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it
is sent and an identification of the business, other entity or individual sending the
message and the telephone number of the sending machine or such business, other
entity or individual. In order to program this information into your fax modem, you
should complete the setup of your fax software before sending messages.

Instructions for IC CS-03 certified equipment
1   The Industry Canada label identifies certified equipment. This certification
means that the equipment meets certain telecommunications network protective,
operational and safety requirements as prescribed in the appropriate Terminal
Equipment Technical Requirements document(s). The Department does not
guarantee the equipment will operate to the user’s satisfaction.
Before installing this equipment, users should ensure that it is permissible to be
connected to the facilities of the local telecommunications company. The
equipment must also be installed using an acceptable method of connection.
The customer should be aware that compliance with the above conditions may
not prevent degradation of service in some situations. Repairs to certified
equipment should be coordinated by a representative designated by the
supplier. Any repairs or alterations made by the user to this equipment, or
equipment malfunctions, may give the  telecommunications company cause to
request the user to disconnect the equipment.
Users should ensure for their own protection that the electrical ground connec-
tions of the power utility, telephone lines and internal metallic water pipe system,
if present, are connected together. This precaution may be particularly important
in rural areas.
CAUTION: Users should not attempt to make such connections them-
selves, but should contact the appropriate electric inspection authority,
or electrician, as appropriate.
2  The user manual of analog equipment must contain the equipment’s Ringer
Equivalence Number (REN) and an explanation notice similar to the following:
The Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) of the modem, which can vary. For the
REN of your modem, refer to your modem’s label.
NOTICE: The Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) assigned to each
terminal device provides an indication of the maximum number of
terminals allowed to be connected to a telephone interface. The termina-
tion on an interface may consist of any combination of devices subject
only to  the requirement that the sum of the Ringer Equivalence Numbers
of all the devices does not exceed 5.

--- Page 9 ---
3 The standard connecting arrangement (telephone jack type) for this equipment is
jack type(s): USOC  RJ11C.
The IC registration number of the modem is shown below.
 Canada: 1353A-L4AINT
Notes for Users in Australia and New Zealand
Modem warning notice for Australia
Modems connected to the Australian telecoms network must have a valid Austel
permit. This modem has been designed to specifically configure to ensure compli-
ance with Austel standards when the country/region selection is set to Australia.
The use of other country/region setting while the modem is attached to the
Australian PSTN would result in you modem being operated in a non-compliant
manner. To verify that the country/region is correctly set, enter the command ATI
which displays the currently active setting.
To set the country/region permanently to Australia, enter the following command
sequence:
AT%TE=1
ATS133=1
AT&F
AT&W
AT%TE=0
ATZ
Failure to set the modem to the Australia country/region setting as shown above
will result in the modem being operated in a non-compliant manner. Consequently,
there would be no permit in force for this equipment and the Telecoms Act 1991
prescribes a penalty of $12,000 for the connection of non-permitted equipment.

Notes for use of this device in New Zealand
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The grant of a Telepermit for a device in no way indicates Telecom acceptance
of responsibility for the correct operation of that device under all operating
conditions. In particular the higher speeds at which this modem is capable of
operating depend on a specific network implementation which is only one of
many ways of delivering high quality voice telephony to customers. Failure to
operate should not be reported as a fault to Telecom.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ In addition to satisfactory line conditions a modem can only work properly if:
a/      it is compatible with the modem at the other end of the call and
b/      the application using the modem is compatible with the application at the
other end of the call - e.g., accessing the Internet requires suitable
software in addition to a modem.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ This equipment shall not be used in any manner which could constitute a
nuisance to other Telecom customers.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Some parameters required for compliance with Telecom’s PTC Specifications
are dependent on the equipment (PC) associated with this modem. The
associated equipment shall be set to operate within the following limits for
compliance with Telecom Specifications:
a/      There shall be no more than 10 call attempts to the same number within
any 30 minute period for any single manual call initiation, and
b/      The equipment shall go on-hook for a period of not less than 30 seconds
between the end of one attempt and the beginning of the next.
c/      Automatic calls to different numbers shall be not less than 5 seconds
apart.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Immediately disconnect this equipment should it become physically damaged,
and arrange for its disposal or repair.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The correct settings for use with this modem in New Zealand are as follows:
ATB0 (CCITT operation)
AT&G2 (1800 Hz guard tone)
AT&P1 (Decadic dialing make-break ratio =33%/67%)
ATS0=0 (not auto answer)
ATS6=4 (Blind dial delay)
ATS7=less than 90 (Time to wait to carrier after dialing)
ATS10=less than 150 (loss of carrier to hangup delay, factory default of 15
recommended)

--- Page 11 ---
ATS11=90 (DTMF dialing on/off duration=90 ms)
ATX2 (Dial tone detect, but not (U.S.A.) call progress detect)
❖❖
❖❖
❖ When used in the Auto Answer mode, the S0 register must be set with a value
of 3 or 4. This ensures:
(a) a person calling your modem will hear a short burst of ringing before  the
modem answers. This confirms that the call has been successfully
switched through the network.
(b) caller identification information (which occurs between the first and
second ring cadences) is not destroyed.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The preferred method of dialing is to use DTMF tones (ATDT...) as this is
faster and more reliable than pulse (decadic) dialing. If for some reason you
must use decadic dialing, your communications program must be set up to
record numbers using the following translation table as this modem does  not
implement the New Zealand “Reverse Dialing” standard.
Number to be dialed: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Number to program into computer: 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Note that where DTMF dialing is used, the numbers should be entered
normally.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The transmit level from this device is set at a fixed level and because of this
there may be circumstances where the performance is less than optimal. Before
reporting such occurrences as faults, please check the line with a standard
Telepermitted telephone, and only report a fault if the phone performance is
impaired.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ It is recommended that this equipment be disconnected from the Telecom line
during electrical storms.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ When relocating the equipment, always disconnect the Telecom line connec-
tion before the power connection, and reconnect the power first.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ This equipment may not be compatible with Telecom Distinctive Alert ca-
dences and services such as FaxAbility.
NOTE: Fault callouts caused by any of the above causes may incur a
charge from Telecom.

General conditions
In general, if you are comfortable, so is your computer, but read the following to
make sure your work site provides a proper environment.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Make sure there is adequate space around the computer for proper ventilation.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Make sure the AC power cord connects to an outlet that is close to the
computer and easily accessible.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The temperature should be 5 to 35 degrees Centigrade (41 to 95 degrees
Fahrenheit) and the relative humidity should be 20 to 80 percent.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Avoid areas where rapid or extreme changes in temperature or humidity may
occur.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Keep the computer free of dust, moisture, and exposure to direct sunlight.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Keep the computer away from heat sources, such as electric heaters.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Do not use the computer near liquids or corrosive chemicals.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Do not place the computer near objects that create strong magnetic fields (e.g.,
stereo speakers).
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Some components in the computer, including data storage media, can be
damaged by magnets. Do not place the computer near magnetic objects or
bring magnetic objects close to the computer. Be careful of objects, such as
stereo speakers, that produce strong magnetic fields during operation. Also, be
careful with metal objects, such as bracelets, which can become magnetized.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Do not operate the computer close to a mobile phone.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Leave ample ventilation room for the fan. Do not block the vents.
Placement of the computer
Position the computer and peripheral devices to provide comfort and safety.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Set the computer on a flat surface at a comfortable height and distance. The
display should be no higher than eye level to avoid eye strain.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Place the computer so that it is directly in front of you when you work and
make sure you have adequate space to easily operate other devices.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Allow adequate space behind the computer to let you freely adjust the display.
The display should be angled to reduce glare and maximize visibility.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ If you use a paper holder, set it at about the same height and distance as the
computer.

ETTING STARTED
Seating and posture
The height of your chair in relation to the computer and keyboard as well as the
support it gives your body are primary factors in reducing work strain. Refer to the
following tips and to figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1  Posture and positioning of the computer
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Place your chair so that the keyboard is at or slightly below the level of your
elbow. You should be able to type comfortably with your shoulders relaxed.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Your knees should be slightly higher than your hips. If necessary, use a foot
rest to raise the level of your knees to ease pressure on the back of your thighs.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Adjust the back of your chair so it supports the lower curve of your spine.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Sit straight so that your knees, hips and elbows form approximately 90 degree
angles when you work. Do not slump forward or lean back too far.

Lighting
Proper lighting can improve legibility of the display and reduce eye strain.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Position the computer so that sunlight or bright indoor lighting does not reflect
off the screen. Use tinted windows, shades or other screen to eliminate sun
glare.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Avoid placing the computer in front of bright light that could shine directly in
your eyes.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ If possible, use soft, indirect lighting in your computer work area. Use a lamp to
illuminate your documents or desk, but be sure to position the lamp so that it
does not reflect off the display or shine in your eyes.
Work habits
A key to avoiding discomfort or injury from repetitive strain is to vary your activi-
ties. If possible, schedule a variety of tasks into your work day. If you must spend
long periods at the computer, finding ways to break up the routine can reduce
stress and improve your efficiency.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Sit in a relaxed posture. Good positioning of your chair and equipment as
described earlier can reduce tension in your shoulders or neck and ease back
strain.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Vary your posture frequently.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Occasionally stand up and stretch or exercise briefly.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Exercise and stretch your wrists and hands a number of times during the day.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Frequently, look away from the computer and focus your eyes on a distant
object for several seconds, for example 30 seconds every 15 minutes.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Take frequent short breaks instead of one or two long breaks, for example, two
or three minutes every half hour.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Have your eyes examined regularly and visit a doctor promptly, if you suspect
you might be suffering from a repetitive strain injury.
A number of books are available on ergonomics and repetitive strain injury or
repetitive stress syndrome. For more information on these topics or for pointers on
exercises for such stress points as hands and wrists, please check with your library
or book vendor. Also refer to the computer’s Instruction Manual for Safety &
Comfort.

CAUTIONS: 1. Save your data. While entering hibernation mode, the
computer saves the contents of memory to the HDD.
However, for safety sake, it is best to save your data
manually.
2. Data will be lost if you remove the battery or discon-
nect the universal AC adaptor before the save is
completed. Wait for the Disk indicator to go out.
3. Do not install or remove a memory module while the
computer is in hibernation mode. Data will be lost.
Benefits of hibernation
The hibernation feature provides the following benefits:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Saves data to the hard disk when the computer automatically shuts down
because of a low battery.
NOTE: For the computer to shut down in hibernation mode, the hiberna-
tion feature must be enabled in two places in TOSHIBA Power Saver: the
Hibernate window and the Battery Alarm item of the Alarm window.
Otherwise, the computer will shut down in Standby mode. If battery power
becomes depleted, data saved in Standby will be lost.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ You can return to your previous working environment immediately when you
turn on the computer.

Data save in hibernation mode
When you turn off the power in hibernation mode, the computer takes a moment to
save current memory data to the hard disk. During this time, the Disk indicator will
light.
After you turn off the computer and memory is saved to the hard disk, turn off the
power to any peripheral devices.
CAUTION: Do not turn the computer or devices back on immediately.
Wait a moment to let all capacitors fully discharge.

Feedback
Your computer’s built-in microphone can be used to record monaural sounds into
your applications and to issue voice commands to applications that support such
functions.
Since your computer also has built-in speakers, “feedback” may be heard under
certain conditions. Feedback occurs when sound from the speaker is picked up in
the microphone and amplified back to the speaker, which amplifies it again to the
microphone.
This feedback occurs repeatedly and causes a loud, high-pitched noise. It is a
common phenomenon that occurs in any sound system when the microphone input
is output to the speaker (throughput) and the speaker volume is too loud or too
close to the microphone. You can control throughput by adjusting the volume as
described in the Volume control item in this section.
Writing CDs on CD-RW/DVD-ROM
drive

❖ In writing to a DVD-R/-RW disc, some disc space is required for file manage-
ment, so you may not be able to write the full capacity of the disc.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Since the disc is based on the DVD standard, it will be filled with dummy data if
the written data is less than about 1 GB. Even if you write only a small amount
of data, it might take time to fill in the dummy data.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Two types of DVD-R/-RW/-RAM discs are on the market: data and video. Use
a video disc to store video data. You can use video discs on a DVD recorder as
well as on your computer’s DVD-ROM drive. You cannot use data discs on a
DVD recorder.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ DVD-RAM formatted by FAT32 cannot be read in Windows 2000 without
DVD-RAM Driver Software.

Please observe the following points when you write or rewrite data.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ When multiple drives that can write data to discs are connected, be careful not
to write to the wrong drive.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Be sure to connect the universal AC adaptor before you write or rewrite.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Before you enter standby/hibernation mode, be sure to finish DVD-RAM
writing. Writing is finished if you can eject DVD-RAM media.

Media care
This section provides tips on protecting data stored on your CD/DVDs and
diskettes.
Handle your media with care. The following simple precautions will increase the
lifetime of your media and protect the data stored on them:
CD/DVDs
1. Store your CD/DVDs in the container they came in to protect them and keep
them clean.
2. Do not bend the CD/DVD.
3. Do not write on, apply a sticker to, or otherwise mar the surface of the
CD/DVD that contains data.
4. Hold the CD/DVD by its outside edge or the edge on the center hole. Finger-
prints on the surface can prevent the drive from properly reading data.
5. Do not expose to direct sunlight, extreme heat or cold. Do not place heavy
objects on your CD/DVDs.
6. If your CD/DVDs become dusty or dirty, wipe them with a clean dry cloth.
Wipe from the center out, do not wipe in a circular direction around the CD/
DVD. If necessary, use a cloth dampened in water or a neutral cleaner. Do not
use benzine, thinner or similar cleaner.
Diskettes
1. Store your diskettes in the container they came in to protect them and keep
them clean. If a diskette is dirty, do not use cleaning fluid. Clean it with a soft
damp cloth.
2. Do not slide back the diskette’s protective metal covering or touch the
diskette’s magnetic surface. Fingerprints may prevent the diskette drive from
reading data from the diskette.
3. Data may be lost if the diskette is twisted; bent; or exposed to direct sunlight,
extreme heat or cold.

The Keyboard
The computer’s keyboard layouts are compatible with a 101/102-key enhanced
keyboard. By pressing some keys in combination, all the 101/102-key keyboard
functions can be executed on the computer.
The number of keys on your keyboard depends on which country/region’s
keyboard layout your computer is configured with. Keyboards for numerous
languages are available.
There are five types of keys: typewriter keys, keypad overlay, function keys, soft
keys and cursor control keys.
Typewriter keys
The typewriter keys, produce the upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, punctua-
tion marks, and special symbols that appear on the screen.
There are some differences, however, between using a typewriter and using a
computer keyboard:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Letters and numbers produced in computer text vary in width. Spaces, which
are created by a “space character,” may also vary depending on line justifica-
tion and other factors.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The lowercase l (el) and the number 1 (one) are not interchangeable on
computers as they are on a typewriter.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The uppercase O (oh) and the 0 (zero) are not interchangeable.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The Caps Lock function key locks only the alphabetic characters in upper-
case while the shift lock on a typewriter places all keys in the shifted position.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The Shift keys, the Tab key, and the BkSp (backspace) key perform the same
function as their typewriter counterparts but also have special computer
functions.

F1 … F12 function keys
The function keys, not to be confused with Fn, are the 12 keys at the top of your
keyboard. These keys function differently from other keys.
F1 through F12 are called function keys because they execute programmed
functions when pressed. Used in combination with the Fn key, keys marked with
icons execute specific functions on the computer. See the section, Soft keys: Fn key
combinations, in this chapter. The function executed by individual keys depends on
the software you are using.
Soft keys: Fn key combinations
The Fn (function) is unique to TOSHIBA computers and is used in combination
with other keys to form soft keys. Soft keys are key combinations that enable,
disable or configure specific features.
NOTE: Some software may disable or interfere with soft-key operations.
Soft-key settings are not restored by the Standby feature.

The keyboard is designed to provide all the features of the 101-key enhanced
keyboard, shown in figure 5-1. The 101/102-key enhanced keyboard has a numeric
keypad and scroll lock key. It also has additional Enter and Ctrl keys to the right of
the main keyboard. Since the keyboard is smaller and has fewer keys, some of the
enhanced keyboard functions must be simulated using two keys instead of one on
the larger keyboard.
Your software may require you to use keys that the keyboard does not have.
Pressing the Fn key and one of the following keys simulates the enhanced
keyboard’s functions.
Press Fn + F10 or Fn + F11 to access the integrated keypad. When activated, the
keys with gray markings on the bottom edge become numeric keypad keys (Fn +
F11) or cursor control keys (Fn + F10). Refer to the Keypad overlay section in this
chapter for more information on how to operate these keys. The power on default
for both settings is off.
Press Fn + F12 (ScrLock) to lock the cursor on a specific line. The power on
default is off.

User's Manual
POWER
Before you remove the battery pack, set the computer to Hibernation mode or save
your data and shut down the computer. Do not change the battery pack while the
universal AC adaptor is connected.
CAUTIONS: 1. The battery pack is a lithium ion battery, which can
explode if not properly replaced, used, handled or
disposed of. Dispose of the battery as required by local
ordinances or regulations. Use only batteries recom-
mended by TOSHIBA as replacements.
2. Do not remove the battery pack while the computer is
in Standby mode. Data is stored in RAM, so if the
computer loses power it will be lost. When the com-
puter is powered off in Standby mode, and the univer-
sal AC adaptor is not connected, the battery pack
supplies power to maintain data and program in
memory. If the battery pack is completely discharged,
Standby mode does not function and the computer
loses all data in memory.
To ensure that the battery pack maintains its maximum capacity, operate the
computer on battery power at least once a month until the battery pack is fully
discharged. Refer to Extending battery life in this chapter for procedures. If the
computer is continuously operated on AC power through a universal AC adaptor
for an extended period, more than a month, the battery may fail to retain a charge. It
may not function efficiently over the expected life of the battery and the Battery
indicator may not indicate a low-battery condition.
Real Time Clock battery
The Real Time Clock (RTC) battery provides power for the internal real time clock
and calendar. It also maintains the system configuration.
If the RTC battery becomes completely discharged, the system loses this data and
the real time clock and calendar stop working. The following message appears when
you turn on the power:
0250: RTC battery is low
0251: CMOS checksum is inconsistent
CAUTION: The computer’s RTC battery is a nickel metal hydride
(NiMH) battery and should be replaced only by your dealer or by a
TOSHIBA service representative. The battery can explode if not properly
replaced, used, handled or disposed of. Dispose of the battery as
required by local ordinances or regulations.

Battery charging notice
The battery may not charge right away under the following conditions:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The battery is extremely hot or cold. If the battery is extremely hot, it might not
charge at all. To ensure the battery charges to its full capacity, charge the
battery at room temperature of 10° to 30°C (50° to 88°F).
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The battery is nearly completely discharged. Leave the universal AC adaptor
connected for a few minutes and the battery should begin charging.
The Battery indicator may show a rapid decrease in battery operating time when
you try to charge a battery under the following conditions:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The battery has not been used for a long time.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The battery has completely discharged and been left in the computer for a long
time.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ A cool battery is installed in a warm computer.
In such case, follow the steps below.
1. Fully discharge the battery by leaving it in the computer with the power on
until the power automatically shuts off.
2. Plug in the universal AC adaptor.
3. Charge the battery until the Battery indicator glows blue.

2. With repeated discharges and recharges, the battery’s
capacity will gradually decrease. Therefore, an often
used, older battery will not operate for as long as a new
battery even when both are fully charged. In this case,
Power Save Modes window in TOSHIBA Power Saver
will indicate a 100% charge for both the old and new
battery, but the displayed estimated time remaining will
be shorter for the older battery.
Maximizing battery operating time
A battery’s usefulness depends on how long it can supply power on a single
charge.
How long the charge lasts in a battery depends on:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ How you configure the computer (for example, whether you enable battery-
power saving options). The computer provides a battery save mode, which can
be set in TOSHIBA Power Saver, to conserve battery power. This mode has
the following options:
• Processor speed
• Monitor brightness
• System standby
• System hibernate
• Turn off monitor
• Turn off hard disks
❖❖
❖❖
❖ How often and how long you use the hard disk, CD/DVD-ROM and the
diskette drive.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ How much charge the battery contained to begin with.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ How you use optional devices, such as a PC card, to which the battery
supplies power.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Enabling Standby mode conserves battery power if you are frequently turning
the computer off and on.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Where you store your programs and data.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Closing the display when you are not using the keyboard saves power.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Operating time decreases at low temperatures.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ The condition of the battery terminals. Make sure the battery terminals stay
clean by wiping them with a clean dry cloth before installing the battery pack.

Chapter 9
Troubleshooting
TOSHIBA designed the computer for durability. However, should problems occur,
following the procedures in this chapter can help to determine the cause.
All readers should become familiar with this chapter. Knowing what might go wrong
can help prevent problems from occurring.
Problem solving process
Resolving problems will be much easier if you observe the following guidelines:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Stop immediately when you recognize a problem exists. Further action may
result in data loss or damage. You may destroy valuable problem-related
information that can help solve the problem.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Observe what is happening. Write down what the system is doing and what
actions you performed immediately before the problem occurred. If you have a
printer attached, print a copy of the screen using PrtSc SysReq.
The questions and procedures offered in this chapter are meant as a guide, they are
not definitive problem solving techniques. Many problems can be solved simply,
but a few may require help from your dealer. If you find you need to consult your
dealer or others, be prepared to describe the problem in as much detail as possible.
Preliminary checklist
Consider the simplest solution first. The items in this checklist are easy to fix and yet
can cause what appears to be a serious problem.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Make sure you turn on all peripheral devices before you turn on the computer.
This includes your printer and any other external device you are using.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Before you attach an external device, turn the computer off. When you turn the
computer back on it recognizes the new device.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Make sure all options are set properly in the setup program.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Check all cables. Are they correctly and firmly attached? Loose cables can
cause signal errors.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Inspect all connecting cables for loose wires and all connectors for loose pins.

--- Page 150 ---
User's Manual
TROUBLESHOOTING
9-2
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Check that your diskette or CD/DVD-ROM is correctly inserted and that the
diskette’s write protect tab is correctly set.
Make notes of your observations and keep them in a permanent error log. This will
help you describe your problems to your dealer. If a problem recurs, the log will help
you identify the problem faster.
Analyzing the problem
Sometimes the system gives clues that can help you identify why it is malfunction-
ing. Keep the following questions in mind:
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Which part of the system is not operating properly: keyboard, diskette drives,
hard disk drive, optical media drive, display. Each device produces different
symptoms.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Is the operating system configuration set properly? Check the configuration
options.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ What appears on the display screen? Does it display any messages or random
characters? Print a copy of the screen if you have a printer attached. Look up
the messages in the software and operating system documentation. Check that
all connecting cables are correctly and firmly attached. Loose cables can cause
erroneous or intermittent signals.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Do any indicators light? Which ones? What color are they? Do they stay on or
blink? Write down what you see.
❖❖
❖❖
❖ Do you hear any beeps? How many? Are they long or short? Are they high
pitched or low? Is the computer making any unusual noises? Write down what
you hear.
Record your observations so you can describe them to your dealer.
Software The problems may be caused by your software or disk. If
you cannot load a software package, the media may be
damaged or the program might be corrupted. Try loading
another copy of the software.
If an error message appears while you are using a software
package, check the software documentation. These
documents usually include a problem solving section or a
summary of error messages.
Next, check any error messages in the OS documentation.

The controller is an advanced Video Graphics Array (VGA) that provides Wide
Extended Graphics Array (WXGA) support for the internal LCD and external
monitors.
The WXGA screen consists of 1280 x 800 pixels.
A high-resolution external monitor connected to the computer can display up to
2048 horizontal and 1536 vertical pixels at 16 M colors.
The display controller also controls the video mode, which uses industry standard
rules to govern the screen resolution and the maximum number of colors that can be
displayed on screen.
Software written for a given video mode will run on any computer that supports the
mode.
The computer’s display controller supports all VGA and SVGA modes, the most

Video modes
The computer supports video modes defined in the tables below. If your application
offers a selection of mode numbers that do not match the numbers on the table,
select a mode based on mode type, resolution, character matrix, number of colors
and refresh rates. Also, if your software supports both graphics and text modes, the
screen display may appear to operate faster using a text mode.

Appendix C
AT Commands
In most cases, you will not need to type AT commands manually. However, there
might be some occasions when you will need to do so.
This chapter describes AT commands for data mode. Fax and voice commands
are taken care of by application software.
The format for entering AT commands is:
ATXn
where X is the AT command, and n is the specific value for that command. After
you type in the command press Enter.
Any command issued is acknowledged with a response in either text or numeric
values known as result codes.
All commands and command-values accepted by the modem are described in this
section; any entry other than those listed results in an error.
+++ Escape sequence
The escape sequence allows the modem to exit data mode and enter
online command mode. While in online command mode, you can
communicate directly to your modem using AT commands. Once you
finish, you can return to data mode using the ATO command.
A pause, the length of which is set by Escape Guard Time (S12), must
be completed after an escape sequence is entered, This pause prevents
the modem from interpreting the escape sequence as data.
The value of the escape sequence character may be changed using
register S2.
A/ Repeat last command
This command repeats the last command string entered. Do not precede
this command with an AT prefix or conclude it by pressing Enter.

Dn Dial
This command instructs the modem to dial a telephone number. Enter n
(the telephone number and any modifiers) after the ATD command.
Any digit or symbol (0-9, *, #, A, B, C, D) may be dialed as touch-tone
digits. Characters such as spaces, hyphens, and parentheses do not
count. They are ignored by the modem, but you may want to include
them to make the number and modifiers easier to read.
The following may be used as phone number modifiers:
P Pulse dialing.
T Touch-tone dialing (default).
, Pause during dialing. Pause for time specified in Register S8
before processing the next character in the dial string.
W Wait for dial tone. Modem waits for a second dial tone before
processing the dial string.
@ Wait for quiet answer. Wait for five seconds of silence after
dialing the number. If silence is not detected, the modem sends
a NO ANSWER result code back to the caller.

Appendix D
S-registers
S-registers contain the settings that determine how a number of functions of the
internal modem operate. For example, how many times to let the telephone ring
before the modem answers and how long to wait before it hangs up if a connec-
tion fails. You can also customize certain AT commands such as the escape
sequence and command line termination.
The contents of the registers are changed automatically when you modify
corresponding settings in your communication software. If you choose, how-
ever, you can display and edit the contents of the registers manually when the
modem is in command mode. If the value is out of the acceptable range, then an
error is generated.
This chapter describes the settings for each S-register.
S-register values
The format for displaying the value of an S-register is:
ATSn?
where n is the register number. After you type in the register press Enter.
The format for modifying the value of an S-register is:
ATSn=r
where n is the register number, and r is the new register value. After you type in
the register and its new value press Enter.
NOTE: Some registers vary from one country/region to another.

User's Manual
D-2
APPENDIX D
S0 Auto answer ring number
This register determines the number of rings the modem will count
before automatically answering a call. Enter 0 (zero) if you do not want
the modem to automatically answer at all. When disabled, the modem
can only answer with an ATA command.
Range: 0-255
Default: 0
Units: rings
S1 Ring counter
This register is read only. The value of S1 is incremented with each ring.
If no ring occurs over a six-second interval, this register is cleared.
Range: 0-225
Default: 0
Units: rings
S2 AT escape character (user defined)
This register determines the ASCII values used for an escape sequence.
The default is the + character. The escape sequence allows the modem
to exit data mode and enter command mode when online. Values greater
than 127 disable the escape sequence.
Range: 0-255, ASCII decimal
Default: 43
Units: ASCII
S3 Command line termination character
(user defined)
This register determines the ASCII values as the carriage return
character. This character is used to end command lines and result
codes.
Range: 0-127, ASCII decimal
Default: 13 (carriage return)
Units: ASCII

--- Page 197 ---
D-3
APPENDIX D
S4 Response formatting character (user defined)
This register determines the ASCII value used as the line feed character.
The modem uses a line feed character in command mode when it
responds to the computer.
Range: 0-127, ASCII decimal
Default: 10 (line feed)
Units: ASCII
S5 Command line editing character (user defined)
This register sets the character recognized as a backspace and pertains
to asynchronous only. The modem will not recognize the backspace
character if it is set to a value that is greater than 32 ASCII. This
character can be used to edit a command line. When the echo command
is enabled, the modem echoes back to the local DTE the backspace
character, an ASCII space character, and a second backspace character.
This means a total of three characters are transmitted each time the
modem processes the backspace character.
Range: 0-127, ASCII decimal
Default: 8 (backspace)
Units: ASCII
S6 Wait before dialing
This register sets the length of time, in seconds, that the modem must
wait (pause) after going off-hook before dialing the first digit of the
telephone number. The modem always pauses for a minimum of two
seconds, even if the value of S6 is less that two seconds. The wait for
dial tone call progress feature (W dial modifier in the dial string) will
override the value in register S6. This operation, however, may be
affected by some ATX options according to country/region restric-
tions. In some countries/regions, S6 will set dial tone detect time.
Range: 3-255
Default: 3
Units: seconds
Appendix D

--- Page 198 ---
User's Manual
D-4
APPENDIX D
S7 Connection completion time-out
This register sets the time, in seconds, that the modem must wait before
hanging up because carrier is not detected. The timer is started when
the modem finishes dialing (originate), or goes off-hook (answer). In
originate mode, the timer is reset upon detection of an answer tone if
allowed by county restriction. The timer also specifies the wait for
silence time for the @ dial modifier in seconds. S7 is not associated with
the W dial modifier.
Range: 1-255
Default: 50
Units: seconds
S8 Comma pause time
This register sets the time, in seconds, that the modem must pause
when it encounters a comma (,) in the dial command string. In some
countries/regions, S8 will set both wait before dialing and comma pause
time.
Range: 0-255
Default: 2
Units: seconds
S11 DTMF dialing speed
This register determines the dialing speed which is prefixed for each
country/region.
Range: 50-255
Default: 95
Units: .001 seconds
S12 Escape guard time
This register sets the value (in 20 millisecond increments) for the
required pause after the escape sequence.
Range: 0-255
Default: 50
Units: .02 seconds

V.90
The TOSHIBA internal modem uses V.90 technology. The modem is capable of
downstream speeds of 56Kbps (kilobits per second) when connected to an Internet
service provider that supports V.90. As with any modem, the actual throughput
(speed of data transfer) depends on analog telephone line conditions, which can
vary considerably. Therefore, many users will experience throughput in the range of
28-50Kbps under normal telephone line conditions. Upstream data flows at the V.34
rate.
NOTE: V.90 rates can be achieved only when one V.90-capable host
modem is connected to another. The TOSHIBA Internal modem will select
automatically V.34 if the remote modem lacks V.90 capability or if a
combination of network and/or phone line conditions prevent V.90
connection.
