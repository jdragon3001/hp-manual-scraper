Listening Cautions                                                           
 
 
 
Hearing Safety     
Listen at a moderate volume: Using headphones at a high 
volume can impair your hearing. This product can produce 
sounds in decibel ranges that may cause hearing loss for a 
normal person, even for exposure less than a minute. The 
higher decibel ranges are offered for those that may have 
already experienced some hearing loss. Sound can be 
deceiving. Over time your hearing ‘comfort level’ adapts to 
higher volumes of sound. So after prolonged listening, what 
sounds ‘normal’ can actually be loud and harmful to your 
hearing. To guard against this, set your volume to a safe 
level before your hearing adapts and leave it there. To 
establish a safe volume level: Set your volume control at a 
low setting. Slowly increase the sound until you can hear it 
comfortably and clearly, without distortion. Listen for 
reasonable periods of time: prolonged exposure to sound, 
even at normally ‘safe’ levels, can also cause hearing loss. 
Be sure to use your equipment reasonably and take 
appropriate breaks. Be sure to observe the following 
guidelines when using your headphones. Listen at 
reasonable volumes for reasonable periods of time. Be 
careful not to adjust the volume as your hearing adapts.   
Do not turn up the volume so high that you can’t hear 
what’s around you. You should use caution or temporarily 
discontinue use in potentially hazardous situations. Do not 
use headphones while operating a motorized vehicle, 
cycling, skateboarding, etc.; it may create a traffic hazard 
and is illegal in many areas.

Warranty Conditions 
The following conditions comprise the requirements and scope of 
our warranty conditions and do not affect our legal and 
contractual warranty obligations. 
We offer a warranty on our products in accordance with the 
following conditions: 
1. AXDIA products are covered by  a 24 month warranty. We 
will resolve damages or defects on AXDIA products free of 
charge within 12 months of the purchase date under the 
following warranty conditions. For any damage or defect 
determined later than 12 months after the purchase date, 
proof  of a manufacturing fault must be submitted for repair 
under warranty.    
The warranty does not cover batteries and other parts, which 
are considered consumables, parts that break easily such as 
glass or plastic or defects based on normal wear and tear. 
There is no warranty obligation in the event of marginal 
differences compared to the target appearance and 
workmanship provided these have a negligible effect on the 
product's fitness for use, in the event of damage caused by 
chemical or electrochemical effects, by water or generally 
from abnormal conditions. 
2. The warranty will be performed in such a way that we shall 
decide whether to repair the defective parts or to replace 
them with working parts free of charge. AXDIA reserves the 
right to exchange the product for a replacement product of 
equal value if the product that is sent in cannot be repaired 
within a reasonable time or at reasonable cost. The product 
can also be exchanged for a different model of the same 
value. Requests cannot be made for repairs to be carried out 
on site. Parts that have been replaced or exchanged become 
our property.

--- Page 45 ---
44 
3. The warranty claim does not apply if repairs or other work is 
carried out by unauthorized persons or if our products are 
equipped with additional parts or accessories that are not 
approved for our products. 
4. Warranties that have been activated do not cause the 
warranty period to be extended, nor do they trigger a new 
warranty period. The warranty period for any replacement 
parts installed ends with the warranty period for the entire 
product. 
5. Any other or further claims are excluded, especially those 
for replacement due to damage caused outside of the 
product, provided there is no obligatory legal liability. We 
therefore accept no liability for accidental, indirect or other 
consequential damage of any kind, which leads to usage 
restrictions, data loss, loss of earnings or interruption to 
business. 
 
Asserting a warranty claim 
1. To make use of the warranty service, you must contact the 
AXDIA Service Center by e-mail, fax or phone (see below for 
contact details). You can also use the service form on our 
website or on the back of the warranty conditions. 
2. AXDIA Service Center will try to diagnose and solve your 
problem. If it is determined that a warranty claim exists, you 
will be given an RMA number (Return Material Authorization) 
and you will be asked to send the product to AXDIA.   
IMPORTANT: AXDIA will only accept parcels that have an 
RMA number.

--- Page 46 ---
45 
Please observe the following when sending the product: 
1. Send  the product suitably packaged with carriage and 
insurance paid. Do not enclose any accessories with the 
products (no cables, CD's, memory cards, manuals, etc.), 
unless the AXDIA Service Centre specifies otherwise. 
2. Mark the RMA number on the outside of the package in 
such a way that it is visible and clearly legible. 
3. You must enclose a copy of the sales slip as proof of 
purchase. 
4. Once AXDIA has received the product, it will meet its 
warranty obligations in accordance with the warranty 
conditions and will return the product to the sender with 
carriage and insurance paid.   
Service outside of warranty 
AXDIA can refuse any service claim made that is not covered by 
the warranty. If AXDIA agrees to provide a service outside the 
warranty, the customer will be invoiced for all repair and transport 
costs.   
AXDIA will not accept any packages that have not first been 
approved by AXDIA by means of an RMA (Return Material 
Authorization).
