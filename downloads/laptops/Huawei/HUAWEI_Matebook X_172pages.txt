 To prevent possible hearing damage, do not listen at high volume levels 
for long periods. 
K  
Using a headset at high volumes may damage your hearing. To reduce this risk, lower 
the headset volume to a safe and comfortable level.
K  
Exposure to high volumes while driving may cause distraction and increase your risk 
of an accident.
Areas with flammables and explosives
K  
Do not use the device in environments where flammables or explosives are stored, 
such as a petrol station, because the electronics in the device may trigger an 
explosion or fire. Always adhere to any warning signs or information that may be 
present in these environments.

Environmental protection
K  
The device and its accessories (if included), such as the power adapter, headset, and 
battery, should not be disposed of with household waste.
K  
Disposal of the device and its accessories is subject to local regulations. Ensure proper 
collection and recycling.
Disposal and recycling information
The crossed-out wheelie bin symbol on your product, battery, literature 
or packaging reminds you that all electronic products and batteries must 
be taken to separate waste collection points at the end of their working 
lives; they must not be disposed of in normal household waste. It is the 
responsibility of the user to dispose of the equipment using a designated 
collection point or service for separate recycling of waste electrical and electronic 
equipment (WEEE) and batteries according to local laws.
Proper collection and recycling of your equipment helps ensure EEE waste is recycled in a 
manner that conserves valuable materials and protects human health and the 
environment. Improper handling, accidental breakage, damage, and/or improper 
recycling at the end of its life may be harmful for your health and the environment. For

Reduction of hazardous substances
This device and any electrical accessories are compliant with local applicable rules on the 
restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic 
equipment, such as EU REACH, RoHS and Batteries (where included) regulations, etc. For 
declarations of conformity about REACH and RoHS, please visit our web site

EU regulatory conformance
Body worn operation
The device complies with RF specifications when used at a distance of 0.0 cm from your 
body. Ensure that the device accessories, such as a device case and device holster, are not 
composed of metal components. Keep the device away from your body to meet the 
distance requirement.
Certification information (SAR)
This device meets guidelines for exposure to radio waves.
Your device is a low-power radio transmitter and receiver. As recommended by 
international guidelines, the device is designed not to exceed the limits for exposure to 
radio waves. These guidelines were developed by the International Commission on Non-
Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an independent scientific organisation, and 
include safety measures designed to ensure the safety of all users, regardless of age and 
health.
The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is the unit of measurement for the amount of radio 
frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a device. The SAR value is 
determined at the highest certified power level in laboratory conditions, but the actual 
SAR level during operation can be well below the value. This is because the device is 
designed to use the minimum power required to reach the network.

Einhaltung der EU-Bestimmungen
Benutzung am Körper
Das Gerät entspricht den RF-Anforderungen, wenn es in einem Abstand von 0,0 cm von 
Ihrem Körper verwendet wird. Achten Sie darauf, keine Zubehörteile wie Etuis und 
Tragetaschen aus Metall zu verwenden. Halten Sie das Gerät von Ihrem Körper fern, um 
den geforderten Abstand einzuhalten.
Informationen zur Zertifizierung (SAR)
Dieses Gerät erfüllt die Richtlinien bezüglich der Belastung durch Funkwellen.
Ihr Gerät ist ein Funksender und -empfänger mit geringem Leistungsverbrauch. Es wurde 
so entwickelt, dass die in den internationalen Richtlinien empfohlenen Grenzwerte für die 
Belastung durch Funkwellen nicht überschritten werden. Diese Richtlinien wurden von 
der Internationalen Strahlenschutzkommission für nichtionisierende Strahlung (ICNIRP) 
erstellt und beinhalten Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, die die Sicherheit aller Nutzer, 
unabhängig von Alter und Gesundheitszustand, gewährleisten sollen.
Die spezifische Absorptionsrate (SAR) ist die Maßeinheit für die Menge der während der 
Verwendung des Geräts vom Körper absorbierten Hochfrequenzenergie. Der SAR-Wert 
wird auf der höchstmöglichen Einstellung unter Laborbedingungen ermittelt. Die 
tatsächliche SAR-Absorptionsrate während des Betriebs kann weit unter diesem Wert 
liegen. Dies liegt daran, dass das Gerät für die geringstmögliche Leistungsaufnahme, die
