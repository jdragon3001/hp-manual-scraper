6. SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE 
 
 
SAFETY GUIDELINES 
In order to achieve maximum safety while using your Razer Blade, we suggest that you 
adopt the following guidelines: 
 
1.  Should you have trouble operating the device properly and troubleshooting does 
not  work,  unplug  the  device  and  contact  the  Razer  hotline  or  go  to 
www.razersupport.com for support. Do not attempt to service or fix the device 
yourself at any time. 
 
3.  Do  not  take  apart  the  device  (doing  so  will  void  your  warranty)  and  do  not 
attempt to operate it under abnormal current loads. 
 
4.  Keep the device away from liquid, humidity or moisture. Operate the device only 
within the specific temperature range of 0°C (32°F) to 40°C (104°F). Should the 
temperature exceed this range, unplug and switch off the device in order to let 
the temperature stabilize to an optimal level. 
 
 
COMFORT 
Research  has  shown  that  long  periods  of  repetitive  motion,  improper  positioning  of 
your computer peripherals, incorrect body position, and poor habits may be associated 
with physical discomfort and injury to nerves, tendons, and muscles.  Below are some 
guidelines to avoid injury and ensure optimum comfort while using your Razer Blade. 
 
1.  Position  your  laptop  directly  in  front  of  you.  If  you  have  an  external  mouse, 
position  it  next to  the laptop.  Place your  elbows  next  to  your side, not  too  far 
away and your mouse within easy reach. 
 
2.  Adjust the height of your chair and table so that the laptop is at or below elbow 
height. 
 
3.  Keep your feet well supported, posture straight and your shoulders relaxed.

--- Page 37 ---
36 | For gamers by gamers™ 
 
4.  During gameplay, relax your wrist and keep it straight. If you do the same tasks 
with your hands repeatedly, try not to bend, extend or twist your hands for long 
periods. 
 
5.  Do not rest your wrists on hard surfaces for long periods. When using an external 
mouse, use a wrist rest to support your wrist while gaming. 
 
6.  Do not sit in the same position all day. Get up, step away from your desk and do 
exercises to stretch your arms, shoulders, neck and legs. 
 
7.  If you should experience any physical discomfort while using your laptop, such as 
pain,  numbness,  or  tingling  in  your  hands,  wrists,  elbows,  shoulders,  neck  or 
back, please consult a qualified medical doctor immediately. 
 
 
BATTERY 
The  Razer  Blade  contains  an  internal,  lithium-ion  polymer  rechargeable  battery.  In 
general,  the  life  expectancy  of  such  batteries  is  dependent  upon  usage.  Heavy  daily 
usage use  will result in shorter battery life. Casual  use will extend battery life. If  you 
suspect  that  the  lithium-ion  rechargeable  battery  inside  the  Razer  Blade  may  be 
drained (has a low charge), try charging it. If the battery does not recharge after several 
attempts,  it  may  be  non-operational.  Dispose  of  batteries  according  to  your  local 
environmental laws and guidelines.
