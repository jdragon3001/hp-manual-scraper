I am having trouble with my PC. How do I perform a system restore?
Sometimes installing a program or driver can make Windows run slowly or 
unpredictably. System Restore can return your PC’s system ﬁles and programs 
to a time when everything was working ﬁne, potentially preventing hours of 
troubleshooting. It won’t affect your documents, pictures, or other data.
1.  Before you start System Restore, save any open ﬁles and close all programs. 
System Restore will restart your PC.
2.  Open System Restore by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type 
System Restore, and then, in the list of results, click System Restore. If you’re 
prompted for an administrator password or conﬁrmation, type the password 
or provide conﬁrmation.
3.  Follow the steps in the wizard to choose a restore point and restore your 
computer.
There is no sound from my PC’s speakers.
•  Increase the volume using the function keys (F8 and F9).
•  Ensure the volume is not muted. Press F7 to toggle the mute function.
•  Increase the volume conrol in Windows.
•  If you are using external speakers or headphones, ensure they are securely 
connected to the PC. If they have a manual volume control, increase the 
volume using that control.

FCC Compliance Statement 
VIZIO  computers  are  classied  by  the  Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) as Class B digital 
devices.
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation 
is subject to the following two conditions: 
(1)  This device may not cause harmful interference, and
(2)  This device must accept any interference received, 
including interference that may cause undesired operation.
Federal Communications Commission Declaration of 
Conformity
This equipment has been tested and found to comply 
with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to part 
15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide 
reasonable protection against harmful interference in a 
residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and 
can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed 
and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause 
harmful interference to radio communications. However, 
there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a 
particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful 
interference to radio or television reception, which can be 
determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user 
is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or 
more of the following measures:
•  Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
•  Increase the separation between the equipment 
and receiver.
•  Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit 
different from that to which the receiver is connected.
•  Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV 
technician for help.”

Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:

The HDD capacity on VIZIO computers may  appear  to be 
smaller than the size stated in the product speciﬁcations, 
documentation or on the packaging. This is because 
manufacturers describe and advertise HDD space in terms 
of decimal capacity, a base of powers of 10. For example, 
one Gigabyte (GB) means 10
9
 = 1,000,000,000 bytes.
 
However, Microsoft® Windows and other operating systems 
and programs report storage capacity using powers of 
two. Thus, 1 GB = 2
30
 = 1,073,741,824 bytes, and shows less 
storage space. Smaller capacity may also be reported 
by the Windows Explorer tool based on information about 
only one partition of the HDD at a time, with free space 
reduced by a hidden service or system recovery partition.  
Available storage capacity will also be less if the computer 
includes one or more pre-installed operating systems, 
pre-installed software applications or media content. The 
storage capacity of the HDD is as advertised but the actual 
formatted capacity may vary.
Exposure to Radio Frequency
Wireless radios and Bluetooth devices emit radio frequency 
electromagnetic energy like other radio devices. While the 
level of energy is less than other wireless devices (such 
as mobile phones), you are advised to use the wireless 
equipment in such a manner that the potential for human 
contact during normal operation is minimized.

ENERGY STAR
®
    
The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ENERGY STAR® 
program is a joint effort between the EPA and manufacturers 
to  promote  energy-efcient  products.    Any  VIZIO  product 
bearing the ENERGY STAR emblem on the product or during 
a start-up screen has been certiﬁed to comply with the EPA 
ENERGY STAR requirements as shipped by VIZIO.

inactivity. To take advantage of this energy savings, the 
Power Management feature has been preset to power 
down the computer and monitor after the following 
speciﬁed periods of inactivity:
Operating 
System
Computer Monitor
On Battery Windows 7 10 minutes 2 minutes
Plugged In Windows 7 15 minutes 5 minutes
Both the computer and monitor can be woken from sleep 
mode through user interaction with any of the computer 
input devices (mouse, keyboard, and so on). You can help 
reduce electricity usage by shutting down your computer 
when it is not in use for longer periods of time, such as 
at night and on weekends.  For more information on the 
ENERGY STAR program, visit: www.energystar.gov.
Screen Savers and Power Settings
Screen savers may prevent your computer from going to 
sleep and as a result waste power. Screen savers may also 
reduce the life of your monitor by increasing the number 
of hours the LCD backlight is on. The power settings of your 
computer are set to minimize energy use while maintaining 
optimal  performance.  Because  of  this VIZIO  recommends 
that you do not disable the power settings.
Reduced Paper Use
For some products, VIZIO provides online-only user manuals. 
This enables us to reduce our carbon footprint and cut 
down on paper waste. It also allows us to make frequent 
product updates, and ensures that you always have the 
most recent product information. Products with an online-
only user manual are packaged with a printed Quick Start 
Guide to help you get up and running quickly.
