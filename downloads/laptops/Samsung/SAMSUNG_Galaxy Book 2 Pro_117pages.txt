Product capacity representation
Storage capacity representation
The capacity of the storage device (HDD, SSD) of the manufacturer 
is calculated assuming that 1 KB = 1,000 Bytes.
However, the operating system (Windows) calculates the storage 
device capacity assuming that 1 KB = 1,024 Bytes. Therefore, the 
available capacity of the HDD in Windows is smaller than the 
actual capacity due to the difference in capacity calculation. For 
example, for an 80 GB HDD, Windows calculates the capacity as 
74.5 GB, (80x1,000x1,000x1,000) Bytes/(1,024x1,024x1,024) Bytes 
= 74.505 GB.
In addition, the capacity representation in Windows may be even 
smaller because some programs, such as Samsung Recovery, may 
reside in a hidden area of the HDD.
Memory capacity representation
The available memory capacity in Windows is less than the actual 
capacity of memory. This is because some memory is required for 
regular system operations.
For example, for 1 GB (= 1,024 MB) memory installed, Windows 
may report the capacity as 1,022 MB or less.
Data precautions
Samsung shall not be liable for any data loss. Please take care to 
avoid losing any important data and back up your data to prevent 
any such data loss.
Operating system and software support
If you change the product’s factory OS (Operating System) to 
another OS or if you install software which is not supported by the 
product’s original factory OS, you will not receive any technical 
support, product exchange or refund, and a fee will be charged 
when requesting a service.
Please use your computer with the original factory OS. If you 
install an OS other than the factory OS, data may be deleted or the 
computer may not start.
* Please use Windows 11 for this model.

Why is the capacity representation of the hard disk 
drive (HDD) in Windows different from the product 
specifications?
The capacity of the storage device (HDD or SSD) of the 
manufacturer is calculated assuming that 1 KB = 1,000 Bytes. 
However, the operating system (Windows) calculates the storage 
device capacity assuming that 1 KB = 1,024 Bytes, and therefore 
the capacity representation of the HDD in Windows is smaller than 
the actual capacity. The capacity representation in Windows may 
be smaller than the actual capacity because some applications 
occupy a certain area of the HDD outside of Windows.
For models with the 
Samsung Recovery
 application, the HDD 
capacity representation in Windows may be smaller than the 
actual capacity because the 
Samsung Recovery
 application 
uses a hidden area of 5–20 GB of the HDD to save the recovery 
image, and that hidden area is not counted towards the total 
size available to Windows. The size of the 
Samsung Recovery
 
application varies by model.
Samsung Recovery
What is a Recovery Area?
The computer has an additional partition for restoring data or 
saving backup files (only for models with the 
Samsung Recovery
 
application). This partition is called a Recovery Area and it 
includes a recovery image comprised of the operating system and 
applications.

What is a recovery image?
This refers to the operating system, drivers, and software that are 
converted to a data image. It is required to recover the computer 
and is embedded in the computer’s HDD. However, this is not 
provided for storage devices where the capacity is less than 64 GB.

Health and safety information
Exposure to Radio Frequency (RF) Signals 
Certification Information
This product can contain an embedded radio transmitter and 
receiver. It is designed and manufactured not to exceed the 
exposure limits for radio frequency (RF) energy set by the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) of the U.S. government. These 
FCC exposure limits are derived from the recommendations of two 
expert organizations, the National Council on Radiation Protection 
and Measurement (NCRP) and the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In both cases, the recommendations 
were developed by scientific and engineering experts drawn from 
industry, government, and academia after extensive reviews of the 
scientific literature related to the biological effects of RF energy.
Before a new model is available for sale to the public, it must be 
certified to the FCC that it does not exceed the exposure limit 
established by the FCC. Evaluation per each model is performed 
in positions and locations (e.g. at the bottom on the body) as 
required by the FCC.
If necessary, the user should consult the dealer or an experienced 
radio/television technician for additional suggestions. The user 
may find the following booklet helpful: “Something About 
Interference.”
This is available at FCC local regional offices. Our company is not 
responsible for any radio or television interference caused by 
unauthorized modifications of this equipment or the substitution 
or attachment of connecting cables and equipment other than 
those specified by our company. The correction will be the 
responsibility of the user. Use only shielded data cables with this 
system.

For corresponding model only
The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is a measure of the rate of 
absorption of RF energy by the human body expressed in units 
of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The FCC wireless devices to comply 
with a safety limit of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).
SAR level of this device while operating can be well below the 
maximum value. This is because the device is designed to operate 
at multiple power levels so as to use only the power required to 
reach the network. In general, the closer you are to a wireless base 
station antenna, the lower the power output.
For body worn operation, this model meets the FCC RF exposure 
guidelines when used with Samsung accessory designated for this 
product. Non-compliance with the above restrictions may result in 
violation of FCC RF exposure guidelines.
RF exposure or SAR information can be viewed on-line at 
www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/. This site uses this product FCC ID 
number on the outside of the product. Sometimes it may be 
necessary to remove the battery pack to find number. Once 
you have the FCC ID number for a particular product, follow the 
instructions on the website and it should provide RF exposure 
information or values for typical or maximum SAR for particular 
product.
