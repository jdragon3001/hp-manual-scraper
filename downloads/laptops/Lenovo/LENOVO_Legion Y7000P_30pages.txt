 Connecting USB device
Your computer comes with three USB ports compatible with USB devices.
T
he first time you plug a USB device into a particular USB port on your computer, Windows 
automatically installs a driver for that device. After the driver has been installed, you can 
disconnect and reconnect the device without performing any additional steps.
Note: Typically, Windows detects a new device after it has been connected, and then installs the driver 
automatically. However, some devices may require you to install the driver before connecting. Check 
the documentation provided by the device’s manufacturer before connecting the device.
Before disconnecting a USB storage device, make sure your computer has finished transferring 
data to that device. Click the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media icon in the Windows 
notification area to remove the device before disconnecting.
Note: If your USB device uses a power cord, connect the device to a power source before connecting it. 
Otherwise, the device may not be recognized.

This section lists frequently asked questions by category.
 Finding information
What safety precautions should I follow when using my computer?
Read and follow all safety precautions included in Lenovo Safety a
nd General Information Guide.
Note: To view Lenovo Safety and General Information Guide, select the Lenovo Vantage (or Lenovo PC 
Manager) icon on the taskbar. You can also download it from the Lenovo Support Web site.
What is the address of the Lenovo support Web site?
http://support.lenovo.com
Where can I find warranty information?
Visit the Lenovo Support Web site and type the serial number for your computer to look up 
w
arranty information.
 Lenovo preinstalled operating system and software
What is the Lenovo preinstalled operating system?
Some Lenovo computers come with copies of the operating system installed at factory. Lenovo 
provides com
puters with a preinstalled operating system for your convenience. If you 
purchased such a computer, you can use your computer out of the box and do not need to install 
a separate operating system.
What is Lenovo preinstalled software?
This is software (developed by Lenovo or other software vendors) installed and licensed at the 
facto
ry for your convenience. The license for some preinstalled software may be for trial 
versions. When the trial period expires, you may need to purchase a license if you want to 
continue to use the software.
Note: If a license agreement is displayed when you first start the software, read the agreement carefully. If 
you don’t accept the terms of the agreement, do not use the software.
When I purchased my computer, it included a copy of Windows. How can I determine whether the 
copy of Windows is preinstalled by Lenovo?
On the outside of the sales package of your co
mputer, you should find a label containing 
configuration information for your computer. Check the printed string next to OS. If it contains 
Windows or WIN, the copy of Windows was preinstalled by Lenovo.
I uninstalled a preinstalled software, but there is no significant increase in the free drive space.
The copy of Windows running on your computer m
ay be Compact-enabled. For computers with 
Compact-enabled Windows, the majority of files needed for preinstalled software are installed 
on the Recovery Partition and won’t be deleted through normal uninstallation.

--- Page 24 ---
20
Chapter 4. Troubleshooting
How can I determine whether the Windows running on my computer is Compact enabled?
Compact technology is normally enabled on copies of
 Windows 10 Update running on SSD (or 
eMMC) -only computer models. To check your computer,
1 Right-click the Start button in the lower-left corner and select Disk Management.
2 The Disk Management program starts.
If Comp
act is labeled on the Windows partition, Compact is enabled on your copy of Windows.
Where can I find drivers for the various h
ardware devices of my computer?
If your computer is preinstalled with a Windows oper
ating system, first check the installation 
program on the C partition of your hard disk (for select models, on the D partition). If you 
cannot find the drivers for all the hardware devices that you need there, download the drivers 
from the Lenovo consumer support web site.
Note: The Lenovo support Web site contains the latest drivers.
 BIOS setup utility
What is the BIOS setup utility?
The BIOS setup utility is ROM-based software. It com
municates basic computer information and 
provides options for setting boot devices, security, hardware mode, and other preferences.
How can I start the BIOS setup utility?
To start the BIOS setup utility:
1 Shut down the computer.
2 Press the Novo button and then select BIOS Setup.
How can I change the boot mode? (on select models)
There are two boot modes: UEFI First an
d Legacy Support. To change the boot mode, start the 
BIOS setup utility and set boot mode to UEFI First or Legacy Support on the boot menu.
When do I need to change the b
oot mode? (on select models)
The default boot mode for your computer is UEFI First mo
de. If you need to install a legacy 
Windows operating system on your computer, you must change the boot mode to Legacy 
Support. The legacy Windows operating system cannot be installed if you don't change the boot 
mode.
 Getting help
How can I contact the customer support center?
