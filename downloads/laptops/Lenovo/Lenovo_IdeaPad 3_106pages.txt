Windows label
Your computer might have a Windows 10 Genuine Microsoft label affixed to its cover depending on the 
following factors: 
•  Your geographic location
•  Edition of Windows 10 that is preinstalled
Go to 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Hardware.aspx for illustrations of the various types of 
Genuine Microsoft labels. 
•  In the People’s Republic of China, the Genuine Microsoft label is required on all computer models 
preinstalled with any version of Windows 10.
•  In other countries and regions, the Genuine Microsoft label is required only on computer models licensed 
for Windows 10 Pro.
The absence of a Genuine Microsoft label does not indicate that the preinstalled Windows version is not 
genuine. For details on how to tell whether your preinstalled Windows product is genuine, refer to the 
information provided by Microsoft at 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/default.aspx.
There are no external, visual indicators of the Product ID or Windows version for which the computer is

the activation.
In some cases, an earlier Windows version might be preinstalled under the terms of the Windows 10 Pro 
license downgrade rights.

Use passwords
This section introduces types of passwords in UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) BIOS (Basic 
Input/Output System) and how to set, change, and remove a password.
Password types
You can set a power-on password, supervisor password, system management passwords, or hard disk 
password in UEFI BIOS to prevent unauthorized access to your computer. However, you are not prompted to 
enter any UEFI BIOS password when your computer resumes from sleep mode.
Power-on password
If you set a power-on password, the icon 
is displayed on the screen when you turn on the computer. 
Enter the correct password to use the computer.

Supervisor password
The supervisor password protects the system information stored in UEFI BIOS. When entering the UEFI 
BIOS menu, enter the correct supervisor password when you are prompted by the icon 
. You also can 
press Enter to skip the password prompt. However, you cannot change most of the system configuration 
options in UEFI BIOS.
If you have set both the supervisor password and power-on password, you can use the supervisor password 
to access your computer when you turn it on. The supervisor password overrides the power-on password.
System management password
The system management password can also protect the system information stored in UEFI BIOS like a 
supervisor password, but it has lower authority by default. The system management password can be set 
through the UEFI BIOS menu or through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) with the Lenovo 
client-management interface.
You can enable the system management password to have the same authority as the supervisor password 
to control security related features. To customize the authority of the system management password through 
the UEFI BIOS menu: 
1.  Enter the UEFI BIOS menu. See “Enter the UEFI BIOS menu” on page 35.
Note: When you are prompted by the icon 
, enter the correct supervisor password if a supervisor 
password has been set, or enter the correct system management password if no supervisor password 
has been set. Otherwise, you cannot change the configurations in the following steps.
2.  Select Security ➙ Password ➙ System Management Password Access Control.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions.
If you have set both the supervisor password and the system management password, the supervisor 
password overrides the system management password. If you have set both the system management 
password and the power-on password, the system management password overrides the power-on 
password.
Hard disk passwords
The hard disk password prevents unauthorized access to the data on the storage drive. When a hard disk 
password is set, you are prompted to type a correct password each time you try to access the storage drive.
To set the hard disk password, select one of the following types: 
•  User hard disk password only
When a user hard disk password is set without a master hard disk password, the user must enter the user 
hard disk password to access files and applications on the storage drive.
•  Master hard disk password + User hard disk password
The master hard disk password is set and used by a system administrator. It enables the administrator to 
access any storage drive in a system or any computer connected in the same network. The administrator 
can also assign a user hard disk password for each computer in the network. The user of the computer 
can change the user hard disk password as desired, but only the administrator can remove the user hard 
disk password.

RAID
This section introduces RAID-related information.
What is RAID
Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a technology that provides increased storage functions and 
reliability through redundancy. It also can improve data storage reliability and fault tolerance compared with 
single-drive storage systems. Data loss resulting from a drive failure can be prevented by reconstructing 
missing data from the remaining drives.
When a group of independent physical storage drives is set up to use RAID technology, they are in a RAID 
array. This array distributes data across multiple storage drives, but the array appears to the host computer 
as one single storage unit. Creating and using RAID arrays provides high performance, such as the expedited 
I/O performance, because several drives can be accessed simultaneously.
Storage drive requirements for RAID levels
Your computer supports the following internal storage drives: 
•  2.5-inch form factor, 7-mm (0.28-inch) height hard disk drive*
•  Intel
® 
Optane™ memory*
•  M.2 Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) solid-state drive*
36
P73 User Guide

--- Page 43 ---
* for selected models
Note: Ensure that your computer has two identical storage drives installed (two M.2 NVMe solid-state drives 
with the same capacity) for supported RAID levels. If only one drive is installed, or two different types of 
drives are installed, the following information does not apply.
Your computer supports the following RAID levels: 
•  RAID 0: striped disk array (missing data resulting from a drive failure cannot be reconstructed)
–  Consists of two identical storage drives 
–  Supported strip size: 4 KB, 8 KB, 16 KB, 32 KB, 64 KB, or 128 KB
–  Better performance without fault tolerance
–  Higher risk of data loss resulting from a member drive failure compared with non-RAID configuration
•  RAID 1: mirrored disk array
–  Consists of two identical storage drives 
–  Improved reading performance and 100% redundancy

This information can help you safely use your computer. Follow and retain all information included with your 
computer. The information in this document does not alter the terms of your purchase agreement or the 
Limited Warranty. For more information, see "Warranty Information" in the Safety and Warranty Guide that 
comes with your computer.
Customer safety is important. Our products are developed to be safe and effective. However, personal 
computers are electronic devices. Power cords, power adapters, and other features can create potential 
safety risks that can result in physical injury or property damage, especially if misused. To reduce these risks, 
follow the instructions included with your product, observe all warnings on the product and in the operating 
instructions, and review the information included in this document carefully. By carefully following the 
information contained in this document and provided with your product, you can help protect yourself from 
hazards and create a safer computer work environment.
Note: This information includes references to power adapters and batteries. In addition, some products 
(such as speakers and monitors) ship with external power adapters. If you have such a product, this

Conditions that require immediate action
Products can become damaged due to misuse or neglect. Some product damage is serious enough 
that the product should not be used again until it has been inspected and, if necessary, repaired by an 
authorized servicer.
As with any electronic device, pay close attention to the product when it is turned on.
On very rare occasions, you might notice an odor or see a puff of smoke or sparks vent from your 
product. Or you might hear sounds like popping, cracking, or hissing. These might merely mean that 
an internal electronic component has failed in a safe and controlled manner. Or, they might indicate a 
potential safety issue. Do not take risks or attempt to diagnose the situation yourself. Contact the 
Customer Support Center for further guidance. For a list of Service and Support phone numbers, see 
the following Web site: 
https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/supportphonelist
Frequently inspect your computer and its components for damage or wear or signs of danger. If you 
have any question about the condition of a component, do not use the product. Contact the Customer 
Support Center or the product manufacturer for instructions on how to inspect the product and have it 
repaired, if necessary.
In the unlikely event that you notice any of the following conditions, or if you have any safety concerns 
with your product, stop using the product and unplug it from the power source and 
telecommunication lines until you can speak to the Customer Support Center for further guidance.
Appendix A. Important safety information 65

cracked, broken, or damaged.
•  Signs of overheating, smoke, sparks, or fire.
•  Damage to a battery (such as cracks, dents, or creases), discharge from a battery, or a buildup of foreign 
substances on the battery.
•  A cracking, hissing, or popping sound, or strong odor that comes from the product. 
•  Signs that liquid has been spilled or an object has fallen onto the computer product, the power cord, or 
power adapter.
•  The computer product, power cord, or power adapter has been exposed to water. 
•  The product has been dropped or damaged in any way. 
•  The product does not operate normally when you follow the operating instructions.
Note: If you notice these conditions with a product (such as an extension cord) that is not manufactured for 
or by Lenovo, stop using that product until you can contact the product manufacturer for further instructions, 
or until you get a suitable replacement.
Service and upgrades
Do not attempt to service a product yourself unless instructed to do so by the Customer Support Center or 
your documentation. Only use a Service Provider who is approved to repair your particular product.
Note: Some computer parts can be upgraded or replaced by the customer. Upgrades typically are referred 
to as options. Replacement parts approved for customer installation are referred to as Customer 
Replaceable Units, or CRUs. Lenovo provides documentation with instructions when it is appropriate for 
customers to install options or replace CRUs. You must closely follow all instructions when installing or 
replacing parts. The Off state of a power indicator does not necessarily mean that voltage levels inside a 
product are zero. Before you remove the covers from a product equipped with a power cord, always ensure 
that the power is turned off and that the product is unplugged from any power source. If you have any 
questions or concerns, contact the Customer Support Center.
Although there are no moving parts in your computer after the power cord has been disconnected, the 
following warnings are required for your safety.
Keep fingers and other parts of your body away from hazardous, moving parts. If you suffer an injury, seek 
medical care immediately.
Avoid contact with hot components inside the computer. During operation, some components become hot 
enough to burn the skin. Before you open the computer cover, turn off the computer, disconnect power, and 
wait approximately 10 minutes for the components to cool.
After replacing a CRU, reinstall all protective covers, including the computer cover, before connecting power 
and operating the computer. This action is important to help prevent unexpected electrical shock and help 
ensure the containment of an unexpected fire that could happen under extremely rare conditions.

Power cords and power adapters
DANGER
Use only the power cords and power adapters supplied by the product manufacturer.
The power cords shall be safety approved. For Germany, it shall be H03VV-F, 3G, 0.75 mm
2
, or 
better. For other countries, the suitable types shall be used accordingly.
Never wrap a power cord around a power adapter or other object. Doing so can stress the cord in 
ways that can cause the cord to fray, crack, or crimp. This can present a safety hazard.
Always route power cords so that they will not be walked on, tripped over, or pinched by objects.
Protect power cords and power adapters from liquids. For instance, do not leave your power cord 
or power adapter near sinks, tubs, toilets, or on floors that are cleaned with liquid cleansers. Liquids 
can cause a short circuit, particularly if the power cord or power adapter has been stressed by 
misuse. Liquids also can cause gradual corrosion of power cord terminals and/or the connector 
terminals on a power adapter, which can eventually result in overheating.
Ensure that all power cord connectors are securely and completely plugged into receptacles.
Do not use any power adapter that shows corrosion at the ac input pins or shows signs of 
overheating (such as deformed plastic) at the ac input pins or anywhere on the power adapter.
Do not use any power cords where the electrical contacts on either end show signs of corrosion or 
overheating or where the power cord appears to have been damaged in any way.
To prevent possible overheating, do not cover the power adapter with clothing or other objects 
when the power adapter is plugged into an electrical outlet.
Extension cords and related devices
Ensure that extension cords, surge protectors, uninterruptible power supplies, and power strips that you use 
are rated to handle the electrical requirements of the product. Never overload these devices. If power strips 
are used, the load should not exceed the power strip input rating. Consult an electrician for more information

approved outlet adapter or to replace the outlet with one that enables this safety feature. Never 
overload an electrical outlet. The overall system load should not exceed 80 percent of the branch 
circuit rating. Consult an electrician for more information if you have questions about power loads 
and branch circuit ratings.
Be sure that the power outlet you are using is properly wired, easily accessible, and located close to 
the equipment. Do not fully extend power cords in a way that will stress the cords.
Be sure that the power outlet provides the correct voltage and current for the product you are 
installing.

Note: For products with mercury-containing fluorescent lamps (for example, non-LED), the fluorescent lamp 
in the liquid crystal display (LCD) contains mercury; dispose of according to local, state, or federal laws.
Use earphones, headphones, or a headset
Excessive sound pressure from earphones and headphones can cause hearing loss. Adjustment of the 
equalizer to maximum increases the earphone and headphone output voltage and the sound pressure level. 
Therefore, to protect your hearing, adjust the equalizer to an appropriate level.
Excessive use of headphones or earphones for a long period of time at high volume can be dangerous if the 
output of the headphone or earphone connectors do not comply with specifications of EN 50332-2. The 
headphone output connector of your computer complies with EN 50332-2 Sub clause 7. This specification 
limits the computer’s maximum wide band true RMS output voltage to 150 mV. To help protect against 
hearing loss, ensure that the headphones or earphones you use also comply with EN 50332-2 (Clause 7 
limits) for a wide band characteristic voltage of 75 mV. Using headphones that do not comply with EN 50332- 
2 can be dangerous due to excessive sound pressure levels.
If your Lenovo computer came with headphones or earphones in the package, as a set, the combination of 
the headphones or earphones and the computer already complies with the specifications of EN 50332-1. If 
different headphones or earphones are used, ensure that they comply with EN 50332-1 (Clause 6.5 
Limitation Values). Using headphones that do not comply with EN 50332-1 can be dangerous due to 
excessive sound pressure levels.

Glass parts notice
CAUTION: 
Some parts of your product may be made of glass. This glass could break if the product is dropped on 
a hard surface or receives a substantial impact. If glass breaks, do not touch or attempt to remove it. 
Stop using your product until the glass is replaced by trained service personnel.
Static electricity prevention
Static electricity, although harmless to you, can seriously damage computer components and options. 
Improper handling of static-sensitive parts can damage the part. When you unpack an option or CRU, do not 
open the static-protective package containing the part until the instructions direct you to install it.
When you handle options or CRUs, or perform any work inside the computer, take the following precautions 
to avoid static-electricity damage:  
•  Limit your movement. Movement can cause static electricity to build up around you.
•  Always handle components carefully. Handle adapters, memory modules, and other circuit boards by the 
edges. Never touch exposed circuitry.
•  Prevent others from touching components.
•  When you install a static-sensitive option or CRU, touch the static-protective package containing the part 
to a metal expansion-slot cover or other unpainted metal surface on the computer for at least two 
seconds. This reduces static electricity in the package and your body.
•  When possible, remove the static-sensitive part from the static-protective packaging and install the part 
without setting it down. When this is not possible, place the static-protective packaging on a smooth, level 
surface and place the part on it.
•  Do not place the part on the computer cover or other metal surface.

Cleaning and maintenance
With appropriate care and maintenance your computer will serve you reliably. The following topics offer 
information to help you keep your computer working with best performance.
Basic maintenance tips
Here are some basic points about keeping your computer functioning properly: 
•  If possible, place your computer in a well-ventilated and dry area without direct exposure to sunshine.
•  Store packing materials safely out of the reach of children to prevent the risk of suffocation from plastic 
bags.
•  Keep your computer away from magnets, activated cellular phones, electrical appliances, or speakers 
(more than 13 cm or 5 inches).
•  Avoid subjecting your computer to extreme temperatures (below 5°C/41°F or above 35°C/95°F).
•  Avoid placing any objects (including paper) between the display and the keyboard or the palm rest.
•  Computer display might be designed to be opened and used at a certain angle. Do not open the display 
with force. Otherwise, the computer hinge might get damaged.
•  Do not turn your computer over when the ac power adapter is plugged in, otherwise, it could break the 
adapter plug.
•  Before moving your computer, be sure to remove any media, turn off attached devices, and disconnect 
cords and cables.
•  When picking up your open computer, hold it by the bottom. Do not pick up or hold your computer by the 
display.
•  Only an authorized Lenovo repair technician should disassemble and repair your computer.
•  Do not modify or tape the latches to keep the display open or closed.
•  Avoid directly exposing your computer and peripherals to the air from an appliance that can produce 
negative ions. Wherever possible, ground your computer to facilitate safe electrostatic discharge.
Clean your computer
It is a good practice to clean your computer periodically to protect the surfaces and ensure trouble-free 
operation.
Clean the computer cover: Wipe it with a lint-free cloth dampened in mild soap and water. Avoid applying 
liquids directly to the cover.
Clean the keyboard: Wipe the keys one by one with a lint-free cloth dampened in mild soap and water. If 
you wipe several keys at a time, the cloth might hook onto an adjacent key and possibly damage it. Avoid 
spraying cleaner directly onto the keyboard. To remove any crumbs or dust from beneath the keys, you can 
use a camera blower with a brush or use cool air from a hair dryer.
Clean the computer screen: Scratches, oil, dust, chemicals, and ultraviolet light can affect the performance 
of your computer screen. Use a dry, soft lint-free cloth to wipe the screen gently. If you see a scratchlike 
mark on your screen, it might be a stain. Wipe or dust the stain gently with a soft, dry cloth. If the stain 
remains, moisten a soft, lint-free cloth with water or eyeglass cleaner, but do not apply liquids directly to your 
computer screen. Ensure that the computer screen is dry before closing it.

Ergonomic information
Good ergonomic practice is important to get the most from your personal computer and to avoid discomfort. 
Arrange your workplace and the equipment you use to suit your individual needs and the kind of work that 
you perform. In addition, use healthy work habits to maximize your performance and comfort when using 
your computer.
Working in the virtual office might mean adapting to frequent changes in your environment. Adapting to the 
surrounding light sources, active seating, and the placement of your computer hardware, can help you 
improve your performance and achieve greater comfort.
This example shows someone in a conventional setting. Even when not in such a setting, you can follow 
many of these tips. Develop good habits, and they will serve you well.
General posture: Make minor modifications in your working posture to deter the onset of discomfort caused 
by long periods of working in the same position. Frequent short breaks from your work also help to prevent 
minor discomfort associated with your working posture.
Appendix B. Accessibility and ergonomic information 79

--- Page 86 ---
Display: Position the display to maintain a comfortable viewing distance of 510 mm to 760 mm (20 inches to 
30 inches). Avoid glare or reflections on the display from overhead lighting or outside sources of light. Keep 
the display screen clean and set the brightness to levels that enable you to see the screen clearly. Press the 
brightness control keys to adjust display brightness.
Head position: Keep your head and neck in a comfortable and neutral (vertical, or upright) position.
Chair: Use a chair that gives you good back support and seat height adjustment. Use chair adjustments to
