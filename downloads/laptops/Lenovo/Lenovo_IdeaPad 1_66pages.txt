Chapter 1. Safety information
This chapter presents the following safety information that you need to be familiar with before you service a 
Lenovo notebook computer.
General safety
Follow these rules to ensure general safety:
•  Observe good housekeeping in the area of the machines during and after maintenance.
•  When lifting any heavy object:  
1.  Make sure that you can stand safely without slipping.
2.  Distribute the weight of the object equally between your feet.
3.  Use a slow lifting force. Never move suddenly or twist when you attempt to lift.
4.  Lift by standing or by pushing up with your leg muscles; this action removes the strain from the 
muscles in your back. Do not attempt to lift any object that weighs more than 16 kg (35 lb) or that you 
think is too heavy for you.
•  Do not perform any action that causes hazards to the customer, or that makes the equipment unsafe.
•  Before you start the machine, make sure that other service technicians and the customer's personnel are 
not in a hazardous position.
•  Place removed covers and other parts in a safe place, away from all personnel, while you are servicing the 
machine.
•  Keep your tool case away from walk areas so that other people will not trip over it.
•  Do not wear loose clothing that can be trapped in the moving parts of a machine. Make sure that your 
sleeves are fastened or rolled up above your elbows. If your hair is long, fasten it.
•  Insert the ends of your necktie or scarf inside clothing or fasten it with a non-conductive clip, about 8 
centimeters (3 inches) from the end.
•  Do not wear jewelry, chains, metal-frame eyeglasses, or metal fasteners for your clothing.  
Attention: Metal objects are good electrical conductors.
•  Wear safety glasses when you are hammering, drilling, soldering, cutting wire, attaching springs, using 
solvents, or working in any other conditions that might be hazardous to your eyes.
•  After service, reinstall all safety shields, guards, labels, and ground wires. Replace any safety device that 
is worn or defective.
•  Reinstall all covers correctly before returning the machine to the customer.
•  Fan louvers on the machine help to prevent overheating of internal components. Do not obstruct fan 
louvers or cover them with labels or stickers.
Electrical safety
Observe the following rules when working on electrical equipment.
Important: Use only approved tools and test equipment. Some hand tools have handles covered with a soft 
material that does not insulate you when working with live electrical currents.Many customers have, near 
their equipment, rubber floor mats that contain small conductive fibers to decrease electrostatic discharges. 
Do not use this type of mat to protect yourself from electrical shock.
•  Find the room emergency power-off (EPO) switch, disconnecting switch, or electrical outlet. If an electrical 
accident occurs, you can then operate the switch or unplug the power cord quickly.
•  Do not work alone under hazardous conditions or near equipment that has hazardous voltages.
•  Disconnect all power before:  
–  Performing a mechanical inspection
–  Working near power supplies
© Copyright Lenovo 2021 1

--- Page 8 ---
–  Removing or installing main units
•  Before you start to work on the machine, unplug the power cord. If you cannot unplug it, ask the customer 
to power-off the wall box that supplies power to the machine, and to lock the wall box in the off position.
•  If you need to work on a machine that has exposed electrical circuits, observe the following precautions:  
–  Ensure that another person, familiar with the power-off controls, is near you.  
Attention: Another person must be there to switch off the power, if necessary.
–  Use only one hand when working with powered-on electrical equipment; keep the other hand in your 
pocket or behind your back.  
Attention: An electrical shock can occur only when there is a complete circuit. By observing the above 
rule, you may prevent a current from passing through your body.
–  When using testers, set the controls correctly and use the approved probe leads and accessories for 
that tester.
–  Stand on suitable rubber mats (obtained locally, if necessary) to insulate you from grounds such as 
metal floor strips and machine frames.
Observe the special safety precautions when you work with very high voltages; Instructions for these 
precautions are in the safety sections of maintenance information. Use extreme care when measuring high 
voltages.
•  Regularly inspect and maintain your electrical hand tools for safe operational condition.
•  Do not use worn or broken tools and testers.
•  Never assume that power has been disconnected from a circuit. First, check that it has been powered off.
•  Always look carefully for possible hazards in your work area. Examples of these hazards are moist floors, 
non-grounded power extension cables, power surges, and missing safety grounds.
•  Do not touch live electrical circuits with the reflective surface of a plastic dental mirror. The surface is 
conductive; such touching can cause personal injury and machine damage.
•  Do not service the following parts with the power on when they are removed from their normal operating 
places in a machine:  
–  Power supply units
–  Pumps
–  Blowers and fans
–  Motor generators
–  Similar units as listed above
This practice ensures correct grounding of the units.
•  If an electrical accident occurs:  
–  Use caution; do not become a victim yourself.
–  Switch off power.
–  Send another person to get medical aid.
Safety inspection guide
The purpose of this inspection guide is to assist you in identifying potentially unsafe conditions. As each 
machine was designed and built, required safety items were installed to protect users and service 
technicians from injury. This guide addresses only those items. You should use good judgment to identify 
potential safety hazards due to attachment of non-Lenovo features or options not covered by this inspection 
guide.
If any unsafe conditions are present, you must determine how serious the apparent hazard could be and 
whether you can continue without first correcting the problem.
Consider these conditions and the safety hazards they present:  
•  Electrical hazards, especially primary power (primary voltage on the frame can cause serious or fatal 
electrical shock)
•  Explosive hazards, such as a damaged cathode ray tube (CRT) face or a bulging capacitor
•  Mechanical hazards, such as loose or missing hardware
2
IdeaPad Series 1 Hardware Maintenance Manual

--- Page 9 ---
To determine whether there are any potentially unsafe conditions, use the following checklist at the 
beginning of every service task. Begin the checks with the power off, and the power cord disconnected.
Checklist:
1.  Check exterior covers for damage (loose, broken, or sharp edges).
2.  Power off the computer. Disconnect the power cord.
3.  Check the power cord for: 
a.  A third-wire ground connector in good condition. Use a meter to measure third-wire ground 
continuity for 0.1 ohm or less between the external ground pin and the frame ground.
b.  The power cord should be the authorized type specified for your computer. Go to: 
http:// 
www.lenovo.com/serviceparts-lookup
c.  Insulation must not be frayed or worn.
4.  Check for cracked or bulging batteries.
5.  Remove the cover.
6.  Check for any obvious non-Lenovo alterations. Use good judgment as to the safety of any non-Lenovo 
alterations.
7.  Check inside the unit for any obvious unsafe conditions, such as metal filings, contamination, water or 
other liquids, or signs of fire or smoke damage.
8.  Check for worn, frayed, or pinched cables.
9.  Check that the power-supply cover fasteners (screws or rivets) have not been removed or tampered 
with.
Handling devices that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge
Any computer part containing transistors or integrated circuits (ICs) should be considered sensitive to 
electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage can occur when there is a difference in charge between objects. 
Protect against ESD damage by equalizing the charge so that the machine, the part, the work mat, and the 
person handling the part are all at the same charge.
Notes: 
1.  Use product-specific ESD procedures when they exceed the requirements noted here.
2.  Make sure that the ESD protective devices you use have been certified (ISO 9000) as fully effective.
When handling ESD-sensitive parts:
•  Keep the parts in protective packages until they are inserted into the product.
•  Avoid contact with other people.
•  Wear a grounded wrist strap against your skin to eliminate static on your body.
•  Prevent the part from touching your clothing. Most clothing is insulative and retains a charge even when 
you are wearing a wrist strap.
•  Use a grounded work mat to provide a static-free work surface. The mat is especially useful when 
handling ESD-sensitive devices.
•  Select a grounding system, such as those listed below, to provide protection that meets the specific 
service requirement.  
Note: The use of a grounding system to guard against ESD damage is desirable but not necessary.
–  Attach the ESD ground clip to any frame ground, ground braid, or green-wire ground.
–  When working on a double-insulated or battery-operated system, use an ESD common ground or 
reference point. You can use coax or connector-outside shells on these systems.
–  Use the round ground prong of the ac plug on ac-operated computers.

Chapter 2. General checkout
This chapter contains the following topics:
Before you go to the checkout instructions, ensure that you read the following important notes.
Important notes:
•  Only certified trained personnel should service the computer.
•  Before replacing any FRU, read the entire page on removing and replacing FRUs.
•  Be extremely careful during such write operations as copying, saving, or formatting. Drives in the computer 
that you are servicing sequence might have been altered. If you select an incorrect drive, data or programs might be 
overwritten.
•  Replace a FRU only with another FRU of the correct model. When you replace a FRU, make sure that the model 
of the machine and the FRU part number are correct by referring to the FRU parts list.
•  A FRU should not be replaced because of a single, unreproducible failure. Single failures can occur for a variety 
of reasons that have nothing to do with a hardware defect, such as cosmic radiation, electrostatic discharge, or 
software errors. Consider replacing a FRU only when a problem recurs. If you suspect that a FRU is defective, clear 
the error log and run the test again. If the error does not recur, do not replace the FRU.
•  Be careful not to replace a nondefective FRU.
What to do first
When you return a FRU, you must include the following information in the parts exchange form or parts return 
form that you attach to it:
1.  Name and phone number of service technician
2.  Date of service
3.  Date on which the machine failed
4.  Date of purchase
5.  Failure symptoms, error codes appearing on the display, and beep symptoms
6.  Procedure index and page number in which the failing FRU was detected
7.  Failing FRU name and part number
8.  Machine type, model number, and serial number
9.  Customer's name and address
Note: During the warranty period, the customer may be responsible for repair costs if the computer damage 
was caused by misuse, accident, modification, unsuitable physical or operating environment, or improper 
maintenance by the customer. Following is a list of some common items that are not covered under warranty 
and some symptoms that might indicate that the system was subjected to stress beyond normal use.
Before checking problems with the computer, determine whether the damage is covered under the warranty

pertain to replacement.
6.  When replacing a FRU, carefully retain and reuse all screws.
7.  When replacing the base cover, reapply all labels that come with the replacement base cover. If some 
original labels are not included with the replacement base cover, peal them off from the original base 
cover and paste them on the replacement base cover. 
DANGER
Before removing any FRU or CRU, shut down the computer and unplug all power cords from 
electrical outlets.
Attention: After replacing a FRU, do not turn on the computer until you have ensured that all screws, 
springs, and other small parts are in place and none are loose inside the computer. Verify this by shaking the 
computer gently and listening for rattling sounds. Metallic parts or metal flakes can cause electrical short 
circuits.
Attention: The system board is sensitive to and can be damaged by ESD. Before touching it, establish 
personal grounding by touching a ground point with one hand or by using an ESD strap (P/N 6405959).
