 Connecting USB devices
You can connect a USB device to your computer by inserting its USB plug 
(Type A) into the USB port on your computer.
The first time you plug a USB device into a particular USB port on your 
computer, Windows automatically installs a driver for that device. After the 
driver has been installed, you can disconnect and reconnect the device 
without performing any additional steps. 
Note: Typically, Windows detects a new device after it has been connected, and then installs 
the driver automatically. However, some devices may require you to install the driver 
before connecting. Check the documentation provided by the device’s manufacturer 
before connecting the device.
Before disconnecting a USB storage device, make sure your computer has 
finished transferring data to that device. Click the Safely Remove Hardware 
and Eject Media icon in the Windows notification area to remove the device 
before disconnecting. 
Note: If your USB device uses a power cord, connect the device to a power source before 
connecting it. Otherwise, the device may not be recognized.

When I purchased my computer, it included a copy of Windows. How can I 
determine whether the copy of Windows is preinstalled by Lenovo?
On the outside of the sales package of your computer, you should find a 
label containing configur
ation information for your computer. Check the 
printed string next to OS. If it contains Windows or WIN, the copy of 
Windows was preinstalled by Lenovo.
What is the Recovery Partition?
If your computer is preinstalled with any ve
rsion of Windows 10, the 
storage device of your computer contains a Recovery Partition. This 
partition contains the image file of the preinstalled Windows operating 
system. In cases of system failure, you can use the Lenovo OneKey 
Recovery system or the Windows Reset feature to restore the operating 
system to its factory status.
Note: The Recovery Partition is not assigned a drive letter and cannot be accessed through 
Windows File Explorer.
I uninstalled a preinstalled software, but there is no significant increase in the 
free drive space.
The copy of Windows running on your computer may be Compact 
technology e
nabled. For computers with Compact technology enabled 
Windows, the majority of files needed for preinstalled software are 
installed on the Recovery Partition and won’t be deleted through normal 
uninstallation.
What happens if I attempt to delete or modify the Recovery Partition?
 Attention:
• Do not delete
 or modify the Recovery Partition on a Compact technology enabled 
computer.
If the Recovery Partition is deleted or modified, you may not be able to 
restore Windows to the factory status. For computer models on which 
Compact technology is enabled, deleting the Recovery Partition may cause 
Windows to fail to start.
How can I determine whether 
the 
Windows running on my computer is 
Compact technology enabled?
Compact technology is normally enabled on
 copies of Windows 10 Update 
running on SSD (or eMMC) -only computer models. To check your 
computer,
