Geng Started
Your EVGA SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING Notebook is powered down during 
the shipping process and must be charged to start. First, connect the charger to the
right side of your notebook and plug the other end into the wall outlet.
Press the power buon to start the EVGA SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING Notebook.
The ﬁrst me you run your EVGA SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING Notebook, 
make sure to plug it in for at least 3 hours to allow it to fully charge.
Conﬁguring Precision X Mobile for the 
EVGA SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING
Precision X Mobile is designed to be the monitoring and tuning suite for your EVGA 
SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING Notebook. This will cover monitoring in the upper 
secon as well as speciﬁc controls for the CPU, Motherboard, Graphics card, lighng, 
and general non-performance/appearance opons.
There are 5 buons on the upper-right side of the main screen that control the overall 
performance aspects of the EVGA SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING.
Custom: This tab will allow you to save custom GPU overclocking values.
Superclock: This seng forces the CPU to run at its Boost clock value of 3.8GHz 
and also pushes the GPU to Boost clock mode as well.
Normal: Default mode, this allows the CPU and GPU to use its boost and throling 
funcons by default based on load.
Silent: CPU runs at default values, GPU cannot go into boost mode, cooling fans run 
at reduced speed.
76

--- Page 6 ---
Downclock: Forces the SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING to run in a throled 
state, using reduced performance for low demand apps, signiﬁcantly reduces heat, 
and extends baery life.
Fan Control:This will open 2 graphs, one for CPU and one for GPU, to let you 
control the balance of temp and fan noise.  If the curve is manually set too low 
for some loads, the fans will ramp up to 100% on their own when there is a risk 
of hardware damage.
FAN BOOST: The FAN BOOST buon located at the boom of the center menu 
will increase all fans to 100% ignoring all preset fan curve informaon.
Fan Control
   
The 2 above curves will funcon the same way.  The square points on the graph 
reference when the GPU or CPU reaches a certain temperature, the fan will 
increase to a speciﬁed percentage.
The curves above are a baseline, you can reduce the speed some to help with 
noise, but the operang temperature will increase.  Also, if noise is not a 
concern you can safely turn the fan speed to 100% and the system will run 
much cooler.
CPU Dashboard:
CPU Clock: This will show the current frequency of your CPU.  The CPU frequency 
will vary based on load, background applicaons, etc. It is common, without 
overclocking, to see this speciﬁc model of CPU ﬂuctuate between 800 MHz and 
3800 MHz (3.8 GHz). Overclocking the CPU will change the frequency parameters, 
but the clocks will sll ﬂuctuate.
CPU Temp: This displays the temperature, in Celsius, of the CPU socket. The Core 
temperature can normally operate in a wide range between 15°C to 100°C due to 
a variety of factors, including CPU Clock, ambient temps, and load level.
CPU Voltage: This monitors the current VCore of the CPU. This will normally ﬂuctuate, 
but may be set to a stac value in Override mode.
98

--- Page 7 ---
1110
GPU Memory: This is the current frequency of your VRAM. The frequency will vary 
based on load. The memory clock will be displayed at half the actual speed of the 
memory; this is a funcon of DDR RAM and completely normal.
Click on the OC buon in the lower le to bring up the new overclocking tool 
(next page), which provides an auto-overclock funcon. This part of the ulity 
funcons much like the desktop version of Precision XOC and the GTX 10 Series 
graphics cards. Precision X Mobile comes with full support for Basic, Linear, and 
Manual curves.
System Temp: This is the temp of the PCH (chipset) on the motherboard. This will 
normally be lower than the CPU temp.
Fan Speed: This is the RPM of the chassis fan. The Fan Speed will adjust based 
on the CPU/GPU/System temp.
Memory Clock: This is the current frequency of your system RAM. The default speed 
is 2400MHz.
GPU Dashboard:
GPU Clock: This will show the current frequency of your GPU.  The GPU Clock will 
vary based on load, background applicaons, etc.
GPU Temp: This displays the temperature, in Celsius, of the GPU. The GPU cannormally 
operate in a wide range between 25°C to 35°C at idle, depending on ambient 
temps, and has a maximum safe limit of 100°C under heavy load.
GPU Voltage: This monitors the current VCore of the GPU. This will normally 
ﬂuctuate, depending on load value and overclocks.  
Fan Speed: This is the RPM of the GPU fan. The Fan Speed will adjust based on the 
GPU temp.

GPU Tab:
This displays the sengs for the GPU.
 
Core Clock Oﬀset: Increase the upper threshold of the GPU clock and boost clock.
Memory Clock Oﬀset: Increase the upper threshold for boost of the Memory clock.
Lighng Tab:
As this soware is universal across all of the EVGA Laptop lines, this tab is present, 
however unused on this model. To control the keyboard lighng please see the 
“Keyboard RGB” buon in the CPU poron of the soware.
1312
CPU Tab:
This displays the current values for the CPU. These are not adjustable, they are 
here for informaonal purposes only.
Core 1:  Displays the current mulplier for Core 1*
Core 2:  Displays the current mulplier for Core 2*
Core 3:  Displays the current mulplier for Core 3*
Core 4:  Displays the current mulplier for Core 4*
Ring:  Displays the current mulplier for the Ring*
VCore Mode: Switches the oponal CPU overclock mode between Adapve and 
Override.*
Adapve – Provides a Voltage target and an oﬀset voltage, providing the BIOS 
                   with a desired range to run within.*
Override – Sets all voltage to a stac value.*
*The Precision X Mobile soware is shared across all EVGA Notebooks. If your EVGA 
SC15 GEFORCE® GTX 1060 GAMING Notebook does not support CPU overclocking, 
the menus will be greyed out and unable to be altered. The Core and Ring values 
will sll display their current mulplier but will funcon as a READ ONLY display.
