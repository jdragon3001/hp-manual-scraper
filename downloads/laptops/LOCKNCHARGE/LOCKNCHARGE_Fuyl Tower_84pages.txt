FUYL Tower™
SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
For your safety – Do not operate the unit if the plug, power socket or power cable is damaged.
To reduce the risk of re, electrical shock and/or injury, the following basic precauons should be followed:
•  This device is not intended for use by persons (including children) with reduced physical, sensory and 
mental capabilies, or lack of experience and knowledge, unless they have been given supervision or 
instrucons concerning the use of the device by a person responsible for their safety.
•  CAUTION: To reduce the Risk of Electric Shock – use only indoors. 
•  Keep away from all sources of water or moisture. Never expose the devices to the rain or dangerous 
gas.
•  Parts of the unit, including devices charging within the unit, may be warm during operaon. Install 
the unit in a dry and cool place and do not cover venlaon holes. Ensure sucient venlaon at all 
mes.
•  Do not overload the socket-outlets.
•  Before using the product, check and make sure all devices are correctly and properly connected.
•  Arrange the power cord away from trac areas where it will not be tripped over.
•  The unit is powered when the main supply is connected and switched on.
•  Do not try to repair, disassemble or modify the unit. There are no user-serviceable parts inside.
•  Do not use the product other than for its intended use.
INSTALLATION
1.  CAUTION: The FUYL Tower weighs 78Kg or 172Lbs. Take appropriate liing precauons while moving.
2.  Lay the delivery carton horizontal, unpack the carton and free the FUYL Tower from the packaging.
3.  Using the keys aached to the base of the cabinet unlock and open the large access door and remove 
the parts box and any packaging that is present.
4.  Locate the 4 adjustable feet and screw them into the corner brackets at the base of the cabinet.
5.  Manoeuvre the FUYL Tower into an upright posion by raising it out of the carton. Use liing 
apparatus if necessary for safe liing. Please discard the packaging with thought for the environment.
6.  When choosing a locaon for the FUYL Tower, consider the following: 
a)  The LCD display will be more readable when ambient light levels are lower. 
b) Direct sunlight should be avoided in hot climates, as temperatures within the unit could exceed 
operang temperatures of stored devices. 
c) Choosing public, well tracked areas will contribute to the safety of users and reduce the likelihood 
of successful break-in. 
d) The main power lead for the FUYL Tower should be connected in a locaon that is concealed, to 
avoid accidental or deliberate power down of the unit while devices are charging. 
e) If network connecvity is needed, a coiled secon of network cable is provided in the undershelf of 
the unit. If necessary, this can be extended using a commonly available Ethernet adaptor.
7.  The locker cabinet will require either a dual mains socket or a permanent electrical juncon box, 
preferably directly behind or above the cabinet. Any necessary electrical installaon should be done 
by suitably qualied installers before the cabinet is moved into place.
8.  If network connecvity will be required then a LAN port or cable must be provided in an appropriate 
locaon close to the cabinet.
9.  The mains supply cables should be ed to the cabinet before it is moved into the nal posion. Plug 
each cable into the appropriate distribuon board, feed the cables through the access point in the 
rear of the cabinet and x both in place using the supplied P-clamps and any other method that may 
be required according to local regulaons.
10.  Posion the FUYL Tower into installaon locaon, 40-90mm from the wall, and level/stabilise the 
cabinet by adjusng the feet at the base. Fix to the wall using the supplied mounng bracket on top of 
the unit. Fixing to the wall is important for stability of the unit and safe operaon.

INSTRUCTION MANUAL
SETUP
Before the cabinet is powered on for the rst me, use the cabinet keys to open the master control door. 
Retrieve the admin keys (secured to the DB9 connector of the controller).
If the baery is already installed in the board on the top of the controller then remove the insulang tag to 
enable the baery connecon. If the baery is not yet installed, then install the 3V Lithium baery (found 
in the parts box) into the holder on the control board, posive (large) side upward. Close and lock the 
master door.
Check that the circuit breakers of both distribuons boards in the base of the cabinet are on, then close and 
lock the access door. Keys for the locker should be held by the person(s) responsible for the locker.
Switch on power to the locker. The controller will take approximately 30 seconds to inialise and boot, and 
then all een locker doors will be opened sequenally.
The lockers are now ready for normal use.
GENERAL USE
Renng a New Locker
The user approaches the locker and begins typing a 
locker number.
When renng a new locker, the user should idenfy 
a locker that is unlocked and make that selecon.
Locker number must be 1 – 15.
Press OK to select when nished.
The user is prompted for a 4 digit PIN to lock the 
door.
NOTE: If the locker was not free, the display will 
indicate that the locker is LOCKED.
The PIN must be conrmed by the user and 
must be a correct match before the door can be 
locked.
Place mobile device in locker and connect to 
charging socket. 
Close the door rmly and the door will latch.
It is now safe to leave the locker.

--- Page 6 ---
FUYL Tower™
Returning to a Locker
The user approaches the FUYL Tower to reclaim 
their charged device.
Select the number of the locker where the mo-
bile device has previously been stored.
The locker is unlocked with the originally entered 
PIN code.
Now the user can reclaim their mobile device and 
is free to leave the locker.
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Locker Breach
If the FUYL Tower detects that a locker door was opened without the PIN code being entered (i.e. with a 
forced entry) an alarm ag will be raised.
 
This message will ash indicang a locker breach
The FUYL Tower will sll be operaonal so that other users can retrieve their items. 
 
Locker Stuck
Occasionally, a door might be held closed or obstructed so that it can’t open. The system will try mulple 
mes to open the door with increasing me increments. Aer a point, the locker will be agged as ‘stuck’ 
and the system will ignore aempts to use that locker. 
The administrator can aempt to free the locker, and can try to unlock the locker again by entering the 
admin keypad override mode. Refer to the secon entled Administraon for details. 
Too many PIN Aempts
When aempng to unlock a locker, the user will be given 3 pin entry aempts. If 3 incorrect aempts are 
made, that locker will be disabled for 60 seconds before another entry aempt can be made.
The locker breach alarm can be reset by using the 
admin key to enter the admin keypad override 
mode. Refer to the Administraon secon for 
instrucons. As soon as the admin mode is entered, 
the locker breach alarm will be reset.

--- Page 7 ---
INSTRUCTION MANUAL
ADMINISTRATION
At mes, an administrator may need to perform maintenance on the system or respond to events such as:
1.  User forgets PIN
2.  Locker breach alarm is triggered
3.  Lockers need to be emped or cleaned out.
The primary way for the administrator to perform these funcons is using the admin keypad override mode.
 
Admin Keypad Override Mode - Authencang
To enter the mode, the administrator will need the control access key provided with the FUYL Tower. Turn 
the key to the right and hold for a moment.
Once the key has been acvated, the administrator will be prompted for their 8 digit authencaon code.
The default authencaon code is 23350743 but for security should be changed as soon as is convenient.
Enter 8 digit auth code
If the admin auth code has been forgoen, it can be reset through the FUYL Tower management portal 
(network connecvity required). 
Refer to the management portal user guide. Alternavely, contact PC Locs / LockNCharge for support.
Note: The keypad auth code is dierent from the password used to access the FUYL Tower management 
portal.
Admin Keypad Override Mode - Authencang
Once authencaon has been successful, opons will be displayed on the screen.
Note: If power has failed to the FUYL Tower, and the 
doors need to be opened, refer to the next secon: 
MANUAL DOOR OVERRIDE
NOTE: More opons can be cycled by turning the 
keyswitch mulple mes.

--- Page 8 ---
FUYL Tower™
Returning to a Locker
Press 1 to force a single locker to open. Aer the 
locker is opened, it will remain in the unlocked 
state, and the old PIN code will be forgoen.
Press 2 to open all the lockers, one by one. All 
lockers will become unlocked, and all PIN codes 
will be forgoen.
Turn the keyswitch to the right to access more 
opons.
Press 3 to change the admin PIN. PINs must be 8 
digits. The PIN will need to be entered twice.
Press 4 to iniate the diagnosc sequence. Please 
consult PC Locs / LocknCharge support before 
taking this step. 
Turn the keyswitch to the right to access more 
opons.
These opons are only relevant when 
performing remote administraon. Please refer 
to the soware manual for the FUYL Tower 
management portal.
MANUAL DOOR OVERRIDE
This can be performed if power is not available to the unit and doors need to be opened.
NOTE: All doors will be opened when using the 
manual override. It is NOT possible to manually open 
individual doors.
Use the maintenance key provided to open the 
control panel door.

--- Page 9 ---
INSTRUCTION MANUAL
Insert the release lever into the cabinet as 
shown.
Firmly press up on the lever to release all the 
doors.
Firmly press down on the lever to reset the 
release latch.
Remove the lever, then close and lock the control 
door.
Once this process is performed, the ongoing state of the lockers will be determined at the moment that 
power is returned. Lockers that were manually opened and le open when the power is returned will be 
unlocked (a breach alarm will need to be cleared). Lockers that are closed and le closed when the power is 
returned will not lose their state – they will connue to be locked as if they were never opened.
For example if:
•  Locker #5 is locked
•  The power is removed
•  The manual override is used to open locker #5
•  If power is returned with the door #5 open, a locker breach alarm will occur. Use admin keypad 
override mode to remove the alarm, then the locker is ready for use.
•  Alternavely, if the door #5 is reclosed before the power returns, then locker #5 will sll be locked, 
with the same PIN as before.
MANAGEMENT PORTAL
The FUYL Tower can be administrated over a wired local network, or by directly connecng to the FUYL 
Tower using an Ethernet cable. This is performed using a browser (Firefox, Explorer, Chrome, Safari). 
Osite administraon is not supported.
There is a separate user guide for the portal which covers the setup process and instrucons for use. Please 
refer to the FUYL Tower Management Portal User Guide.

UNGEWÖHNLICHE UMSTÄNDE
Schließfacheinbruch
Erkennt der FUYL Tower, dass eine Schließfachtür (gewaltsam) geönet wurde, ohne den PIN-Code 
einzugeben, wird ein Alarmsignal ausgelöst.
 
Blinkende Meldung bei einem Schließfacheinbruch
Der FUYL Tower bleibt funkonsfähig, sodass andere Anwender Ihre Schließfächer önen können. 
 
Klemmendes Schließfach
Unter Umständen kann eine Tür versperrt bleiben oder klemmen, sodass diese nicht geönet werden kann. 
Das System wird dann mehrmals in zunehmend längeren Zeitabständen versuchen, die Tür zu önen. Ab 
einem besmmten Punkt wird das problemasche Schließfach als klemmend („stuck“) markiert und weitere 
Önungsversuche unterbleiben. 
Administratoren können versuchen, die Schließfachtür mit dem Admin-Hauptschlüssel-Modus zu entriegeln 
und manuell zu lösen. Weitere Informaonen nden Sie im Abschni „Administraon“. 
Zu viele PIN-Versuche
Für die Entriegelung eines Schließfaches stehen 3 PIN-Eingabeversuche zur Verfügung. Nach 3 ungülgen 
Versuchen wird ein Schließfach für 60 Sekunden gesperrt, bevor ein erneuter Eingabeversuch gestaet wird.
Um dem FUYL Tower ein darin gelagertes Gerät 
zu entnehmen ...
Tippen Sie die Nummer des betreenden Schließ-
faches ein.
Geben Sie die 4-stellige PIN an, um die Tür zu

PUESTA EN FUNCIONAMIENTO
Antes de encender el gabinete por primera vez, use las llaves del gabinete para abrir la puerta principal de 
control. Recoja las llaves del administrador (sujetas al conector DB9 del controlador).
Si la pila ya está instalada en el tablero en la parte superior del controlador, entonces quite la equeta de 
aislamiento para habilitar la conexión de la pila. Si la pila todavía no está instalada, entonces instale la pila 
de lio de 3V (se encuentra en la caja de partes) en el receptáculo del tablero de control, el lado posivo 
(grande) hacia arriba. Cierre con llave la puerta principal.
Compruebe que los disyuntores de circuitos de ambos tableros de distribución ubicados en la base del 
gabinete estén encendidos, luego cierre con llave la puerta de acceso. Las llaves de la taquilla las debe 
guardar la(s) persona(s) responsable(s) de la taquilla.
Encienda la alimentación de la taquilla. El controlador necesitará aproximadamente 30 segundos para 
inicializarse y arrancar, y luego las quince puertas de las taquillas se abrirán secuencialmente.
Las taquillas ahora están listas y se pueden usar normalmente.
USO GENERAL
Alquiler de una taquilla nueva
El usuario llega a la taquilla y comienza escribiendo 
el número de la taquilla.

FUYL Tower™
CIRCUNSTANCIAS NO HABITUALES
Taquilla forzada
Si la FUYL Tower detecta que la puerta de una taquilla se ha abierto sin el código PIN (es decir, la puerta ha 
sido forzada), se acvará una alarma.
 
Este mensaje se encenderá intermitentemente para indicar que una taquilla ha sido forzada
La FUYL Tower todavía funcionará para que otros usuarios puedan rerar sus disposivos. 
 
Taquilla bloqueada
En ocasiones, una puerta puede quedar retenida o bloqueada de manera que no pueda abrirse. El sistema 
intentará abrir la puerta varias veces a intervalos de empo cada vez más largos. Después de cierto empo, 
se indicará que la taquilla está “bloqueada” y el sistema ignorará los intentos de usar la taquilla.
El administrador puede intentar acceder a la taquilla y puede intentar abrir la taquilla de nuevo 
ingresando en el modo de anulación del teclado numérico del administrador. Consulte la sección tulada 
Administración para obtener información detallada. 
Demasiados intentos de ingreso de PIN
Cuando intente abrir una taquilla, el usuario dispondrá de 3 intentos de ingreso de PIN. Si el usuario realiza 
3 intentos incorrectos, la taquilla se desacvará durante 60 segundos antes de que se pueda realizar otro 
intento de ingreso de PIN.
Volver a usar una taquilla
El usuario vuelve a la FUYL Tower para recoger su 
disposivo cargado.
Seleccione el número de la taquilla en la que se 
guardó previamente el disposivo móvil.
La taquilla se abre con el código PIN que se 
introdujo originalmente.
Ahora el usuario puede recoger su disposivo 
móvil y marcharse.
La alarma de taquilla forzada se puede reiniciar usando la llave del administrador para 
ingresar en el modo de anulación del teclado numérico del administrador. Consulte 
la sección tulada Administración para obtener instrucciones. Tan pronto como se 
ingresa en el modo de administrador la alarma de taquilla forzada se reiniciará.

INSTRUCTION MANUAL
ADMINISTRACIÓN
A veces, es posible que un administrador deba hacer mantenimiento en el sistema o responder a 
circunstancias como:
1.  1.  El usuario olvida el PIN
2.  2.  Se acva la alarma de taquilla forzada.
3.  3.  Las taquillas se deben vaciar o limpiar.
El principal recurso que ene el administrador para realizar estas funciones es usar el teclado numérico del 
administrador con modo de anulación.
 
Modo de anulación del teclado numérico del administrador: autencación
Para ingresar en el modo, el administrador necesitará la llave de acceso al control que se proporciona con la 
FUYL Tower. Gire la llave hacia la derecha y espere un momento.
Una vez que la llave se haya acvado, el administrador deberá ingresar su código de autencación de 8 
dígitos. El código de autencación predeterminado es 23350743 pero por seguridad debería cambiarse tan 
pronto como sea conveniente.
Ingrese el código de autencación de 8 dígitos
Si olvida el código de autencación del administrador, puede restablecerlo mediante el portal de gesón de 
la FUYL Tower (es necesario tener conecvidad de red).
Consulte la guía del usuario del portal de gesón. Alternavamente, póngase en contacto con PC Locs/
LockNCharge para recibir asistencia. Nota: El código de autencación del teclado numérico es diferente a la 
contraseña usada para acceder al portal de gesón de la FUYL Tower.
Modo de anulación del teclado numérico del administrador: opciones de menú
Una vez que la autencación se ha realizado correctamente, las opciones se mostrarán en la pantalla.
Nota: Si el suministro eléctrico de la FUYL Tower se ha interrumpido 
y las puertas se deben abrir, consulte la sección siguiente:
ANULACIÓN MANUAL DE LAS PUERTAS
NOTA: Se pueden alternar más opciones girando el 
interruptor de llave varias veces.

FUYL Tower™
Returning to a Locker
Pulse 1 para forzar la apertura de una única 
taquilla. Una vez que la taquilla está abierta, 
permanecerá en estado abierto y el código PIN 
anguo se olvidará. 
Pulse 2 para abrir todas las taquillas, una por 
una. Todas las taquillas se abrirán y todos los 
códigos PIN se olvidarán.
Gire el interruptor de llave hacia la derecha para 
acceder a más opciones.
Pulse 3 para cambiar el PIN del administrador. 
El PIN debe tener 8 dígitos. El PIN se deberá in-
gresar dos veces. Pulse 4 para iniciar la secuencia 
de diagnósco. Consulte la asistencia de PC Locs 
/ LocknCharge antes de dar este paso. 
Gire el interruptor de llave hacia la derecha para 
acceder a más opciones.
Estas opciones solo son relevantes cuando se realice 
administración remota. Consulte el manual del 
soware para el portal de gesón de la FUYL Tower.
ANULACIÓN MANUAL DE LAS PUERTAS
Esto se puede realizar si la unidad no recibe suministro eléctrico y es necesario abrir las puertas.
NOTA: Todas las puertas se abrirán cuando se use 
la anulación manual. NO es posible abrir puertas 
individuales manualmente.
Use la llave de mantenimiento que se 
proporciona para abrir la puerta del panel de 
control.

--- Page 33 ---
INSTRUCTION MANUAL
Inserte la palanca de liberación en el gabinete 
como se muestra.
Presione la palanca hacia arriba rmemente para 
liberar todas las puertas.
Presione la palanca hacia abajo rmemente para 
restablecer el pesllo de liberación.
Rere la palanca, luego cierre con llave la puerta 
del panel de control.
Una vez realizado este proceso, el estado actual de las taquillas se determinará en el momento en que se 
restablezca el suministro eléctrico. Las taquillas que se hayan abierto manualmente y se dejen abiertas 
cuando se restablezca el suministro eléctrico permanecerán abiertas (será necesario desacvar una 
alarma de taquilla forzada). Las alarmas que esté cerradas y se dejen cerradas hasta el momento en que se 
restablezca el suministro eléctrico no perderán su estado y connuarán estando cerradas como si nunca se 
hubieran abierto.
Por ejemplo, si:
•  La taquilla número 5 está cerrada
•  El suministro eléctrico se interrumpe
•  La anulación manual se usa para abrir la taquilla número 5
•  Si el suministro eléctrico se restablece con la taquilla número 5 abierta, se acvará una alarma de 
taquilla forzada. Use el modo de anulación del teclado numérico del administrador para desacvar la 
alarma, luego la taquilla está lista para su uso. 
•  Alternavamente, si la puerta de la taquilla número 5 se vuelve a cerrar antes de que se restablezca el 
suministro eléctrico, entonces la taquilla número 5 connuará cerrada con el mismo PIN que tenía antes.
PORTAL DE GESTIÓN
La FUYL Tower se puede administrar por medio de una red local alámbrica o conectando directamente con la 
FUYL Tower usando un cable de Ethernet. Esto se realiza usando un navegador (Firefox, Explorer, Chrome, Safari). 
La administración fuera del sio no es posible.

INSTALLATION
1.  MISE EN GARDE : la FUYL Tower pèse 78 kg ou 172 livres. Prenez 
les précauons appropriées pour soulever la tour en la déplaçant.
2.  Placez le carton d'emballage à l'horizontale avant de déballer la 
FUYL Tower.
3.  Déverrouillez et ouvrez la grande porte d'accès avec les clés 
aachées au socle du boîer, puis rerez la boîte avec les 
composants ainsi que tout autre emballage.
4.  Vissez ensuite les 4 pieds réglables dans les alésages d'angle à la 
base du boîer.
5.  Posionnez la FUYL Tower à la vercale en la sortant du carton. Si 
nécessaire, ulisez un appareil de levage pour ne pas vous blesser 
(poids de la tour). Veuillez mere les emballages au rebut en 
respectant la législaon en vigueur en maère de recyclage des 
emballages usés.
6.  Suivez les recommandaons suivantes pour choisir l'emplacement 
d'installaon de la FUYL Tower : 
a) L'acheur à cristaux liquides sera plus lisible si le niveau de 
luminosité ambiante est faible. 
b) Évitez d'exposer la tour aux rayons du soleil dans les pays 
chauds, car la température dans l'unité peut dépasser la 
température de service des appareils mobiles stockés à l'intérieur. 
c) Séleconnez un emplacement fréquenté, de préférence public, 
pour réduire le risque d'une intrusion non autorisée dans l'armoire. 
d) Le raccordement du câble d'alimentaon secteur de la FUYL 
Tower ne doit pas être apparent, ceci pour éviter toute coupure de 
courant, accidentelle ou délibérée, lorsque les appareils mobiles 
sont en régénéraon. 
e) Si la connecvité réseau est requise, uliser le câble réseau 
enroulé dans le comparment inférieur de l'unité. Si nécessaire, 
ulisez un adaptateur Ethernet standard pour étendre la 
connexion.
7.  Le boîer de l'armoire nécessite une double prise secteur ou un 
coret électrique de raccordement, de préférence directement 
derrière ou au-dessus de l'armoire. L'installaon électrique doit 
être réalisée par un électricien qualié avant de mere l'armoire 
en place.
8.  Si la connexion réseau est requise, ulisez une prise de 
branchement Ethernet ou un câble à proximité de l'armoire.
9.  Les câbles d'alimentaon secteur doivent être raccordés à 
l'armoire avant d'installer celle-ci dénivement. Branchez chaque 
câble dans la carte de distribuon appropriée, puis faites passer 
les câbles par les points d'accès correspondants à l'arrière de 
l'armoire. Terminez en les xant avec les pinces P fournies ou toute 
autre méthode requise selon la réglementaon locale en vigueur.
10. Posionnez la FUYL Tower dans son emplacement d'installaon, à 
40-90 mm du mur. Meez l'armoire de niveau en réglant les pieds 
au niveau du socle. Fixez l'armoire au mur avec la pae de xaon 
en haut de l'unité. La xaon au mur est importante, car elle 
garant la stabilité de l'unité et la sécurité de fonconnement.

UTILISATION GÉNÉRALE
Locaon d'une nouvelle armoire ('Locker')
L'ulisateur s'approche de  l'armoire  et  commence à 
saisir le numéro de l'armoire.
Pour louer une armoire, l'ulisateur doit idener et 
séleconner une armoire non verrouillée.
Le numéro d'armoire doit être compris entre 1 et 15.
Pressez  sur  OK  pour  séleconner  lorsque  vous  avez 
terminé.
L'ulisateur  doit  maintenant  saisir  le  code 
d'idencaon à 4 chires pour verrouiller la porte.
REMARQUE  :  si  l'armoire  n'est  pas  libre,  l'achage 
indique que l'armoire est VERROUILLÉE (« LOCKED »).
L'ulisateur  doit  conrmer  le  code  d'idencaon 
correspondant pour verrouiller la porte.
Disposez l'appareil mobile dans l'armoire et connectez-
le à la prise de régénéraon. 
Fermez  la  porte  (le  loquet  doit  se  mere  en  place 
automaquement).
Vous pouvez maintenant laisser votre appareil mobile 
dans l'armoire en toute sécurité.

CIRCONSTANCES INHABITUELLES
Intrusion dans une armoire
Si la FUYL Tower détecte qu'une porte d'armoire a été ouverte sans saisir le code d'idencaon 
correspondant (autrement dit, en cas d'intrusion de force), le système déclenche une alarme.
 
Ce message va clignoter sur l'écran pour indiquer qu'une armoire a été forcée
La FUYL Tower connue de fonconner pour permere aux autres ulisateurs de récupérer leurs appareils. 
 
Armoire bloquée
À l'occasion, une porte peut rester bloquée ou coincée et ne pas s'ouvrir. Le système va tenter d'ouvrir la porte 
à mulples reprises avec à chaque fois un intervalle de temps de plus en plus long. À parr d'un certain point, 
le système considère que l'armoire est 'bloquée' (« Stuck » en anglais) et ignorer les tentaves d'uliser cee 
armoire. 
L'administrateur peut tenter de débloquer l'armoire et peut essayer de déverrouiller celle-ci en ulisant le clavier 
d'administraon (mode d'accès prioritaire). Référez-vous à la secon Administraon pour plus de détails. 
Tentaves de code PIN trop nombreuses
L'ulisateur dispose de 3 essais de saisie de code d'idencaon pour déverrouiller l'armoire. En cas 
d'échec, l'armoire sera désacvée pendant 60 secondes avant de pouvoir eectuer un nouvel essai.
Retour à une armoire ('Locker')
L'ulisateur s'approche de la FUYL Tower pour 
récupérer l'appareil régénéré.
Séleconnez le numéro de l'armoire dans la-
quelle l'appareil a été rangé.
L'armoire est déverrouillée avec le code d'iden-
caon saisi auparavant.
L'ulisateur peut maintenant récupérer l'appareil 
mobile et quier l'armoire.
L'alarme de détecon d'intrusion de force dans l'armoire peut être 
désacvée en ulisant la clé Administrateur pour entrer dans le mode 
d'accès prioritaire. Référez-vous à la secon Administraon pour les 
instrucons correspondantes. Dès que le système détecte l'entrée dans 
le mode d'accès prioritaire, l'alarme d'intrusion de force sera réinialisée.

NOTICE D'UTILISATION
ADMINISTRATION
L'administrateur doit parfois eectuer des tâches de maintenance du système ou réagir en cas de :
1.  Code d'idencaon ulisateur oublié
2.  Déclenchement de l'alarme d'intrusion dans l'armoire
3.  Nécessité de vider ou de neoyer les armoires.
Pour eectuer ces opéraons, l'administrateur ulise principalement le clavier correspondant de mode d'accès 
prioritaire.
 
Mode Prioritaire clavier Admin – Authencaon
Pour entrer dans ce mode, l'administrateur a besoin de la clé de contrôle d'accès fournie avec la FUYL 
Tower. Tourner la clé vers la droite et la maintenir dans cee posion pendant un instant.
Une fois la clé acvée, le système va demander à l'administrateur de saisir le code d'authencaon à 
8 chires.
Le code d'authencaon par défaut est 23350743, mais il peut être changé aussi souvent que nécessaire 
pour des raisons de sécurité.
Saisie du code d'authencaon à 8 chires
Si le code d'authencaon de l'administrateur a été oublié, il peut être réinialisé par l'intermédiaire du 
portail d'administraon de la FUYL Tower (connexion réseau requise). 
Référez-vous au manuel d'ulisaon du portail d'administraon. Alternavement, contactez le support

FUYL Tower™
ISTRUZIONI PER LA SICUREZZA
Per la tua sicurezza – Non ulizzare l’unità se la spina, la presa di rete o il cavo di alimentazione sono danneggia.
Per ridurre il rischio di incendio, scossa elerica e/o infortuni, osservare le seguen precauzioni di base:
•  Questo disposivo non è progeato per essere ulizzato da persone (compresi bambini) con capacità 
siche, sensoriali o mentali ridoe, o con mancanza di esperienza e conoscenza, a meno che non siano 
controllate durante l’ulizzo del prodoo da una persona responsabile per la loro sicurezza.
•  ATTENZIONE: Per ridurre il rischio di scossa elerica - solo in ambien chiusi.
•  Tenere lontano da fon di acqua o umidità. Non esporre il disposivo a pioggia o gas pericoloso.
•  Le par dell’unità, incluso i disposivi che si caricano nell’unità, possono surriscaldarsi durante il 
funzionamento. Installare l’unità in un luogo asciuo e fresco e non coprire i fori di venlazione. 
Assicurare sempre una venlazione suciente.
•  Non sovraccaricare le uscite della presa.
•  Prima di usare il prodoo, controllare e assicurare che tu i disposivi siano correamente e 
idoneamente collega.
•  Posizionare il cavo lontano da aree tracate dove non si inciampa.
•  L’unità è alimentata quando l’alimentazione è collegata e accesa.
•  Non cercare di riparare, smontare o modicare l’unità. All’interno non ci sono par riparabili dall’utente.
•  Usare il prodoo solo per il suo uso inteso.
INSTALLAZIONE
1.  ATTENZIONE: FUYL Tower pesa 78 Kg o 172 libbre. Prendere le precauzioni necessarie prima di spostare.
2.  Porre il cartone di consegna in orizzontale, aprire il cartone e rimuovere FUYL Tower dall’imballaggio.
3.  Ulizzando le chiavi alla base del cabinet sbloccare e aprire il portello di accesso grande e rimuovere la 
scatola dei pezzi e qualsiasi materiale di imballaggio presente.
4.  Posizionare i 4 piedi regolabili e avvitarli nelle stae angolari alla base del cabinet.
5.  Manovrare il FUYL Tower in posizione vercale sollevandolo dal cartone. Usare il disposivo di 
sollevamento, se necessario, per un sollevamento sicuro. Smalre l’imballaggio nel rispeo dell’ambiente.
6.  Quando si sceglie una posizione per il FUYL Tower, considerare quanto segue: 
a) Il display LCD sarà più leggibile quando i livelli di luce dell’ambiente sono più bassi. 
b) Luce solare direa deve essere evitata in climi caldi, poiché le temperature all’interno dell’unità possono 
superare le temperature operave dei disposivi contenu. 
c) La scelta di aree pubbliche ben tracate contribuirà alla sicurezza degli uten e ridurrà la probabilità di 
violazione con successo. 
d) Il lo di alimentazione del FUYL Tower deve essere collegato in una posizione nascosta, per evitare lo 
scollegamento accidentale o deliberato dell’unità mentre i disposivi sono in carica. 
e) Se è necessaria connevità di rete, una sezione avvolta del cavo di rete è prevista al di soo dell’unità. 
Se necessario, può essere estesa usando un adaatore Ethernet comunemente disponibile.
7.  Il cabinet dell’armadieo richiederà una presa di alimentazione doppia o una scatola di derivazione 
elerica permanente, preferibilmente direamente dietro o sopra il cabinet. Qualsiasi installazione 
elerica necessaria deve essere eeuata da installatori qualica prima che il cabinet sia spostato in 
posizione.
8.  Se è necessaria connevità di rete, un cavo o porta LAN deve essere posto in una posizione appropriata 
vicina al cabinet.
9.  I cavi di alimentazione principali devono essere posa all’interno del cabinet prima di spostarlo nella 
posizione nale. Collegare ogni cavo alla scheda di distribuzione appropriata, far passare i cavi araverso 
il punto di accesso sul retro del cabinet e ssarli in posizione usando i morse a P forni e qualsiasi altro 
metodo necessario secondo le normave locali.

MANUALE D’ISTRUZIONI
CONFIGURAZIONE
Prima di alimentare il cabinet per la prima volta, ulizzare le chiavi del cabinet per aprire il portello di 
controllo principale. Recuperare le chiavi amministratore (assicurate al conneore D89 della centralina).
Se la baeria è già installata sulla scheda sulla parte superiore della centralina, rimuovere la linguea 
isolante per avare il collegamento della baeria. Se la baeria non è ancora installata, installare la baeria 
al lio da 3V (si trova nella scatola delle par) nel supporto sulla scheda di controllo, lato posivo (grande) 
verso l’alto. Chiudere e bloccare il portello principale.
Controllare che gli interruori di circuito di entrambe le schede di distribuzione nella base del cabinet siano 
ave, quindi chiudere e bloccare la porta di accesso. Le chiavi dell’armadieo devono essere conservate dal 
responsabile dell’armadieo.
Accendere l’alimentazione dell’armadieo. La centralina impiegherà circa 30 secondi per inizializzare e 
riavviare, e quindi tu e quindici portelli degli armadie saranno aper in sequenza.
Gli armadie ora sono pron per l’uso normale.
USO GENERALE
Noleggio di un nuovo armadieo
L’utente si avvicina all’armadieo e inizia a digitare il 
numero di armadieo.
Quando si noleggia un nuovo armadieo, l’utente deve 
idencare un armadieo che è sbloccato e selezionarlo.
Il numero di armadieo deve essere 1 – 15.
Premere OK per selezionare quando nito.
All’utente è chiesto di inserire un PIN a 4 cifre per 
bloccare il portello.
NOTA: Se l’armadieo non è libero, il display indica 
che l’armadieo è BLOCCATO.
Il PIN deve essere confermato dall’utente e deve 
avere una corrispondenza correa prima che il 
portello possa essere bloccato.
Porre il disposivo mobile nell’armadieo e 
collegare la presa di carica. 
Chiudere fermamente il portello e la porta si chiude.
È ora sicuro lasciare l’armadieo.

--- Page 54 ---
FUYL Tower™
Ritorno a un armadieo
L’utente si avvicina al FUYL Tower per prendere il 
proprio disposivo caricato.
Selezionare il numero di armadieo in cui il 
disposivo mobile è stato precedentemente 
conservato.
L’armadieo è sbloccato con il codice PIN inserito 
originariamente.
Ora l’utente può prendere il proprio disposivo 
mobile ed è libero di lasciare l’armadieo.
CIRCOSTANZE INSOLITE
Violazione armadieo
Se il FUYL Tower rileva che il portello di un armadieo è stato aperto senza l’immissione del codice PIN (ad 
es. con un accesso forzato) apparirà una bandierina di allarme.
 
Questo messaggio lampeggia indicando una violazione dell’armadieo
FUYL Tower sarà ancora operavo in modo che altri uten possano recuperare i propri ogge. 
 
Bloccaggio armadieo
Occasionalmente, un portello potrebbe essere tenuto chiuso od ostruito in modo da non potersi aprire. Il sistema 
cercherà più volte di aprire il portello con l’aumento di incremen di tempo. Dopo un punto, l’armadieo sarà 
contrassegnato come ‘bloccato’ e il sistema ignorerà i tentavi di ulizzo di tale armadieo.
L’amministratore  può  tentare  di  liberare  l’armadieo  e  può  cercare  di  sbloccare  nuovamente  l’armadieo 
accedendo  alla  modalità  di  avazione  mediante  taserino  amministratore.  Fare  riferimento  alla  sezione 
intolata Amministrazione per i deagli. 
Troppi tentavi di immissione PIN
Quando si tenta di sbloccare un armadieo, all’utente saranno da 3 tentavi di immissione del PIN. Se sono 
eeua 3 tentavi erra, l’armadieo sarà disabilitato per 60 secondi prima di poter eeuare un nuovo tentavo.
L’allarme per violazione dell’armadieo può essere riprisnato usando 
la chiave amministratore per accedere alla modalità di avazione 
mediante taserino amministratore. Fare riferimento alla sezione 
Amministrazione per le istruzioni. Non appena si accede alla modalità 
amministratore, l’allarme di violazione dell’armadieo sarà riprisnato.

--- Page 55 ---
MANUALE D’ISTRUZIONI
AMMINISTRAZIONE
A volte, un amministratore può aver bisogno di eseguire la manutenzione sul sistema o risponde a even quali:
1.  Utente dimenca PIN
2.  Allarme violazione armadieo avato
3.  Gli armadie devono essere svuota o ripuli.
Il modo principale per l’amministratore di eseguire queste funzioni è ulizzare la modalità di avazione 
mediante taserino amministratore.
 
Modalità di avazione mediante taserino amministratore - Autencazione
Per accedere alla modalità, l’amministratore ha bisogno della chiave di accesso di controllo fornita con il 
FUYL Tower. Girare la chiave verso destra e mantenerla per un momento.
Una volta che la chiave è stata avata, all’amministratore sarà chiesto il codice di autencazione di 8 cifre. Il 
codice di autencazione predenito è 23350743 ma per sicurezza può essere modicato.
Immeere il codice di autencazione a 8 cifre
Se il codice di autencazione dell’amministratore è stato dimencato, può essere riprisnato araverso il 
portale di gesone FUYL Tower (connevità di rete necessaria).
Fare riferimento alla Guida Utente Portale Gesone. In alternava, contaare PC Locs / LockNCharge per 
assistenza. Nota: Il codice di autencazione del taserino è diverso dalla password usata per accedere al 
portale di gesone FUYL Tower.
Modalità di avazione mediante taserino amministratore - Autencazione
Una volta che l’autencazione è avvenuta con successo, le opzioni saranno visualizzate sullo schermo.
Nota: Se sul FUYL Tower manca l’alimentazione, e i portelli 
devono essere aper, fare riferimento alla sezione successiva: 
ATTIVAZIONE PORTELLO MANUALE
NOTA: più opzioni possono essere alternate 
girando più volte l’interruore a chiave.

FUYL Tower™
Ritorno a un armadieo
Premere 1 per forzare l’apertura di un singolo 
armadieo. Dopo che l’armadieo è aperto, esso 
resterà in stato sbloccato, e il vecchio codice PIN 
sarà dimencato.
Premere 2 per aprire tu gli armadie, uno per 
volta. Tu gli armadie saranno sblocca e tu 
i codici PIN saranno dimenca.
Girare l’interruore a chiave verso destra per 
accedere ad
altre opzioni.
Premere 3 per modicare il PIN amministratore. 
I PIN devono essere di 8 cifre. Il PIN dovrà essere 
inserito due volte. Premere 4 per avviare la 
sequenza diagnosca. Consultare l’assistenza PC 
Locs / LocknCharge prima di eeuare questo 
passo.
Girare l’interruore a chiave verso destra per 
accedere ad altre opzioni.
Queste opzioni sono importan sono quando si 
eeua la gesone remota. Fare riferimento al 
manuale del soware per il portale di gesone di 
FUYL Tower.
ATTIVAZIONE PORTELLO MANUALE
Può essere eseguito se l’alimentazione non è disponibile per l’unità e i portelli devono essere aper.
NOTA: Tue le porte saranno aperte quando si 
ulizza l’avazione manuale. NON è possibile 
aprire manualmente i singoli portelli.
Ulizzare la chiave di manutenzione fornita per 
aprire il portello del pannello di controllo.

--- Page 57 ---
MANUALE D’ISTRUZIONI
Inserire la leva di rilascio nel cabinet come 
mostrato.
Premere fermamente in alto sulla leva per rilasci-
are tu i portelli.
Premere fermamente in basso sulla leva per 
riprisnare tu il blocco di rilascio.
Rimuovere la leva, quindi chiudere e bloccare il 
portello di controllo.
Una volta che questa procedura è eseguita, lo stato degli armadie sarà determinato al momento in cui 
l’alimentazione è ritornata. Gli armadie che sono sta aper manualmente e lascia aper quando 
l’alimentazione è ritornata saranno sblocca (un allarme di violazione deve essere annullato). Gli armadie 
che sono chiusi e lascia aper quando l’alimentazione è ritornata non perderanno il loro stato - essi 
connueranno ad essere blocca come se non fossero sta mai aper.
Per esempio se:
•  Armadieo #5 bloccato
•  L’alimentazione è rimossa
•  L’avazione manuale è usata per aprire l’armadieo #5
•  Se l’alimentazione è ritornata con il portello #5 aperto, si vericherà un allarme di violazione 
dell’armadieo. Ulizzare la modalità di avazione mediante taserino amministratore per rimuovere 
l’allarme, quindi l’armadieo è pronto per l’uso.
•  In alternava, se il portello #5 è richiuso prima del ritorno della corrente, l’armadieo #5 sarà ancora 
bloccato, con lo stesso PIN di prima.
PORTALE GESTIONE
Il FUYL Tower può essere amministrato su una rete locale cablata o mediante collegamento direo al FUYL 
Tower usando un cavo Ethernet. Ciò è eseguito usando un browser (Firefox, Explorer, Chrome, Safari).

Se a bateria já esver instalada na placa na parte superior do controlador, rere a equeta isolante para permir 
a ligação da bateria. Se ainda não esver instalada, instale a bateria de lío de 3 V (encontrada na caixa de peças) 
no suporte do quadro de comando, lado posivo (grande) virado para cima. Feche e tranque a porta principal.
Verique se os disjuntores de ambos os quadros de distribuição na base do armário estão ligados e feche e 
tranque a porta de acesso. As chaves do cacifo devem ser guardadas pela(s) pessoa(s) responsável(is) pelo cacifo.
Ligue a alimentação do cacifo. O controlador demora aproximadamente 30 segundos a inicializar e arrancar e 
todas as 15 portas do cacifo abrirão sequencialmente.
Agora os cacifos estão prontos para ulização normal.
UTILIZAÇÃO GERAL
Alugar um novo cacifo
O ulizador aproxima-se do cacifo e começa a 
inserir um número de cacifo.
Ao alugar um novo cacifo, o ulizador deve iden-
car um cacifo que esteja destrancado e selecioná-lo.
O número do cacifo deve ser entre 1 e 15.
Prima OK para selecionar quando terminar.
É solicitado ao ulizador um PIN de 4 dígitos para 
trancar a porta.
NOTA: se o cacifo não esver livre, o ecrã indica 
que o cacifo está TRANCADO.
O PIN deve ser conrmado pelo ulizador e deve 
ser uma correspondência correta antes de a 
porta trancar.
Coloque o disposivo móvel no cacifo e ligue-o à 
tomada de carregamento. 
Feche bem a porta e irá trancar.
Agora é seguro abandonar o cacifo.

CIRCUNSTÂNCIAS INCOMUNS
Violação de cacifo
Se a FUYL Tower detetar que a porta de um cacifo foi aberta sem a introdução do código PIN (isto é, entrada 
forçada), é emido um sinalizador de alarme.
 
Esta mensagem pisca indicando a violação de um cacifo
A FUYL Tower connua operacional para que os restantes ulizadores possam recuperar os seus itens. 
 
Cacifo preso
Ocasionalmente, uma porta pode car fechada ou obstruída, não sendo possível abri-la. O sistema irá 
tentar abrir a porta várias vezes com incrementos de tempo crescentes. Após certo ponto, o cacifo é 
sinalizado como "preso" e o sistema irá ignorar tentavas de ulização do mesmo. 
O administrador pode tentar libertar o cacifo e tentar desbloqueá-lo novamente ao entrar no modo de 
contorno com teclado do administrador. Consulte a secção denominada Administração para obter detalhes. 
Demasiadas tentavas de PIN
Ao tentar destrancar um cacifo, o ulizador pode introduzir o PIN três vezes. Se forem efetuadas três 
tentavas incorretas, esse cacifo ca desavado durante 60 segundos até ser possível efetuar outra 
tentava.
Voltar a um cacifo
O ulizador aproxima-se da FUYL Tower para 
recuperar o disposivo carregado.
Selecione o número do cacifo onde o disposivo 
móvel foi armazenado.
O cacifo é destrancado com o código PIN introdu-
zido originalmente.
Agora o ulizador pode recuperar o disposivo 
móvel e abandonar o cacifo.
O alarme de violação do cacifo pode ser reposto ulizando a 
chave do administrador para entrar no modo de contorno com 
teclado do administrador. Consulte a secção Administração 
para obter instruções. Assim que o modo de administrador é 
acedido, o alarme de violação do cacifo é reposto.

MANUAL DE INSTRUÇÕES
ADMINISTRAÇÃO
Às vezes, um administrador pode necessitar de efetuar a manutenção do sistema ou responder a eventos, 
tais como:
1.  O ulizador esqueceu-se do PIN
2.  O alarme de violação do cacifo foi acionado
3.  Os cacifos têm de ser esvaziados ou limpos.
A principal forma de o administrador executar estas funções é através da ulização do modo de contorno 
com teclado do administrador.
 
Modo de contorno com teclado do administrador - Autencação
Para entrar no modo, o administrador necessita da chave de acesso de controlo fornecida com a FUYL 
Tower. Rode a chave para a direita e aguarde.
Assim que a chave ver sido avada, é solicitado ao administrador o código de autencação de 8 dígitos.
O código de autencação predenido é 23350743, mas, por movos de segurança, deve ser alterado assim 
que possível.
Introduzir código de autorização de 8 dígitos
Se ver esquecido o código de autencação do administrador, pode ser reposto através do portal de gestão 
da FUYL Tower (conecvidade de rede necessária). 
Consulte o guia do ulizador do portal de gestão. Em alternava, contacte a PC Locs/LockNCharge para 
obter suporte.
Nota: o código de autorização do teclado é diferente da palavra-passe ulizada para aceder ao portal de 
gestão da FUYL Tower.
Modo de contorno com teclado do administrador - Autencação
Após uma autencação bem-sucedida, as opções serão apresentadas no ecrã.
Nota: se houver corte de energia na FUYL Tower 
e for necessário abrir as portas, consulte a secção 
seguinte: CONTORNO MANUAL DAS PORTAS
NOTA: é possível ver mais opções 
ao rodar a chave várias vezes.

--- Page 68 ---
FUYL Tower™
NOTA: as portas serão todas abertas ao ulizar 
o contorno manual. NÃO é possível abrir 
manualmente portas individuais.
Voltar a um cacifo
Prima 1 para forçar a abertura de um cacifo. 
Depois de o cacifo abrir, permanece no estado 
destrancado e o código PIN ango é esquecido.
Prima 2 para abrir todos os cacifos, um a um. 
Os cacifos cam todos destrancados e todos os 
códigos PIN são esquecidos.
Rode a chave para a direita para aceder a mais 
opções.
Prima 3 para alterar o PIN do administrador. Os 
PIN devem ter 8 dígitos. É necessário introduzir o 
PIN duas vezes.
Prima 4 para iniciar a sequência de diagnósco. 
Consulte o suporte da PC Locs/LocknCharge 
antes realizar este passo. 
Rode a chave para a direita para aceder a mais 
opções.
Estas opções só são relevantes na administração 
remota. Consulte o manual do soware do 
portal de gestão da FUYL Tower.
CONTORNO MANUAL DAS PORTAS
Pode ser executado se não houver alimentação na unidade e for necessário abrir as portas.
Ulize a chave de manutenção fornecida para 
abrir a porta do painel de controlo.

MANUAL DE INSTRUÇÕES
Insira a alavanca de libertação no armário como 
mostrado.
Empurre rmemente a alavanca para cima para 
destrancar todas as portas.
Empurre rmemente a alavanca para baixo para 
repor o fecho de libertação.
Rere a alavanca, feche e tranque a porta de 
controlo.
Aquando da execução deste processo, o estado connuo dos cacifos será determinado no momento de 
regresso da energia. Os cacifos abertos manualmente e que caram abertos carão destrancados quando 
a energia voltar (é necessário apagar um alarme de violação). Os cacifos fechados e que estavam fechados 
quando a energia voltou não perdem o seu estado. Connuam trancados como se nunca vessem sido 
abertos.
Por exemplo, se:
•  O cacifo 5 está trancado
•  Não há energia
•  O contorno manual é ulizado para abrir o cacifo 5
•  Se a energia voltar com a porta 5 aberta, é emido um alarme de violação de cacifo. Ulize o controlo 
com teclado do administrador para remover o alarme e o cacifo está pronto a ser ulizado.
•  Em alternava, se a porta 5 for fechada antes de a energia voltar, o cacifo 5 connua trancado, com o 
mesmo PIN.
PORTAL DE GESTÃO

VEILIGHEIDSINSTRUCTIES
Voor uw veiligheid -  Gebruik de unit 
niet als de stekker, het stopcontact of de 
voedingskabel beschadigd is.
Om het risico op brand, elektrische 
schok en/of letsel te beperken 
dienen de volgende elementaire 
voorzorgsmaatregelen gevolgd te worden:
•  Dit apparaat is niet bedoeld om 
gebruikt te worden door personen 
(inclusief kinderen) met beperkte 
fysieke, sensorische en geestelijke 
capaciteiten of die een gebrek aan 
ervaring en kennis hebben tenzij ze 
onder toezicht staan of instruces 
hebben betreende het gebruik 
van het apparaat van iemand die 
verantwoordelijk is voor hun veiligheid.
•  WAARSCHUWING: Gebruik om het 
risico op elektrische schok te beperken 
alleen binnenshuis.
•  Houd verwijderd van water of vocht. 
Stel de apparaten nooit bloot aan regen 
of gevaarlijke gassen.
•  Onderdelen van de unit, inclusief 
apparaten die binnen de unit aan het 
opladen zijn, kunnen jdens gebruik 
warm zijn. Installeer de unit op een 
droge en koele locae en dek de 
venlaegaten niet af. Zorg te allen 
jde voor voldoende venlae.
•  Zorg ervoor dat de stopcontacten niet 
overbelast raken.
•  Voordat het product gebruikt wordt 
dient u te controleren en ervoor te 
zorgen dat alle apparaten juist en 
deugdelijk aangesloten zijn.
•  Houd de voedingskabel uit de buurt 
van plaatsen met veel verkeer en zorg 
dat ervoor dat er niet over gestruikeld 
kan worden.
•  De unit is ingeschakeld als de 
netvoeding wordt aangesloten en 
ingeschakeld is.
•  Probeer de unit niet te repareren, 
demonteren of aan te passen. Er 
zien geen onderdelen in die door 
de gebruiker onderhouden moeten 
worden.
•  Gebruik het product niet voor een ander 
doel dan waarvoor het bedoeld is.
INSTALLATIE
1.  WAARSCHUWING: De FUYL Tower weegt 78 kg of 172 lbs. Neem 
de juiste voorzorgsmaatregelen als u deze wilt verplaatsen.
2.  Leg de doos horizontaal, pak het karton uit en haal de FUYL 
Tower uit de verpakking.
3.  Gebruik de sleutel die aan het onderstel van de kast bevesgd 
is, open de grote toegangsdeur en verwijder de doos met de 
onderdelen en eventueel aanwezige verpakking.
4.  Vind de 4 verstelbare poten en schroef deze in de hoekbeugels 
aan het onderstel van de kast.
5.  Plaats de FUYL Tower rechtop door deze uit de doos te llen. 
Gebruik hijsapparatuur indien nodig voor veilig llen. Gooi de 
verpakking weg op een milieuvriendelijke wijze.
6.  Overweeg bij het kiezen van een locae voor de FUYL Tower het 
volgende: 
a) Het LCD-scherm is beter leesbaar als omgevingslicht minder 
sterk is. 
b) In een warm klimaat dient direct zonlicht vermeden te 
worden omdat de bedrijfstemperatuur van de opgeslagen 
apparaten overschreden kan worden als de temperatuur in de 
unit te hoog is. 
c) Als er een openbare ruimte gekozen wordt waar veel verkeer 
is zal dit bijdragen aan de veiligheid van gebruikers en wordt de 
kans op inbraak kleiner. 
d) De hoofdvoeding voor de FUYL Tower dient op een 
verborgen locae aangesloten te worden zodat toevallige of 
opzeelijke uitschakeling van de stroom van de unit vermeden 
wordt terwijl de apparaten aan het opladen zijn. 
e) Indien verbinding met het netwerk nodig is, is er een 
opgerolde sece van netwerkkabel beschikbaar op de 
onderplank van de unit. Dit kan eventueel verlengd worden met 
een algemeen verkrijgbare Ethernet-adapter.
7.  Er is een dubbel stopcontact of een permanente aansluitkast 
nodig bij voorkeur direct achter of boven de kast. Voordat de 
kast op de juiste locae geplaatst wordt dienen eventuele 
benodigde elektrische installaewerkzaamheden door een 
geschikte installateur uitgevoerd te worden.
8.  Voor netwerkverbinding is een LAN-poort of kabel nodig op een 
geschikte locae vlakbij de kast.
9.  De kabels voor de hoofdvoeding dienen aan de kast aangepast 
te worden voordat de kast op de denieve locae geplaatst 
wordt. Sluit iedere kabel aan op de juiste verdeelkast. Leid de 
kabels door het toegangspunt aan de achterkant van de kast 
en gebruik de bijgeleverde klemmen om ze vast te zeen en 
andere methodes die op grond van lokale regelgeving vereist 
zijn.
10. Plaats de FUYL Tower op de locae van installae, 40-90 
mm van de wand en zorg ervoor dat de kast waterpas staat/
gestabiliseerd is door de poten van het onderstel af te stellen. 
Bevesg aan de wand met de bijgeleverde montagebeugel aan 
de bovenkant van de unit. Bevesging aan de wand is belangrijk 
voor de stabiliteit van de unit en veilig gebruik.

--- Page 77 ---
HANDLEIDING
INSTELLING
Voordat de kast voor de eerste keer ingeschakeld wordt dient u de bedieningsdeur met de kastsleutels te 
openen. Neem de beheersleutel (bevesgd aan het D89-verbindingsstuk van de controller).
Als de baerij al geïnstalleerd is in het bord aan de bovenkant van de controller verwijdert u de isolerende 
strip zodat de baerij verbinding maakt. Als de baerij nog niet geïnstalleerd is dient u de 3 V lithium 
baerij (in de doos met onderdelen) in de houder in het bedieningsbord te installeren met de posieve 
(grote) kant omhoog. Sluit en vergrendel de masterdeur.
Zorg ervoor dat de stroomonderbrekers in beide verdeelkasten onder in de kast ingeschakeld zijn en sluit en 
vergrendel de toegangsdeur. De sleutels van de kluis dienen bewaard te worden door de persoon/personen 
die verantwoordelijk zijn voor deze kluis.
Schakel de stroom in op de kluis. Het duurt ongeveer 30 seconden voor de controller om te inialiseren en 
op te starten waarna de deuren van alle vijien kluisjes opeenvolgend zullen openen.
De kluisjes zijn nu gereed voor gebruik.
ALGEMEEN GEBRUIK
Een nieuwe kluis huren
De gebruiker voert een nummer van een kluis in.
Als er een nieuwe kluis gehuurd wordt dient de 
gebruiker een kluis te kiezen die ontgrendeld is.
Nummer van de kluis dient tussen de 1 - 15 te liggen.
Druk op OK als selece gemaakt is.
De gebruiker wordt gevraagd om een 4-cijferige pincode 
in te voeren om de deur te vergrendelen.
OPMERKING: Als de kluis niet beschikbaar is wordt er op 
het display aangegeven dat de kluis VERGRENDELD is.
De gebruiker moet de PIN bevesgen en dit moet 
overeenkomen voordat de deur vergrendeld kan 
worden.
Plaats het mobiele apparaat in de kluis en sluit aan op 
het stopcontact. 
Sluit de deur stevig en de deur wordt vergrendeld.
U kunt nu bij de kluis vandaan te lopen.

Klemmende kluis
Het kan gebeuren dat een deur klem komt te zien. Het systeem zal meerdere keren proberen om de deur 
te openen, waarbij de tussenliggende jd toeneemt. Na een aantal pogingen wordt er aangegeven dat de 
kluis “klem” zit waarna het systeem geen poging meer doet om de kluis te openen.
De beheerder kan proberen om de kluis te openen door de ophengsmodus beheerders in te voeren. 
Raadpleeg het onderdeel Beheerder voor aanwijzingen. 
Maximum aantal PIN pogingen
De gebruiker hee 3 pogingen om de juiste PIN in te voeren. Als er 3 keer een verkeerde PIN ingevoerd wordt, 
wordt de kluis gedurende 60 seconden uitgeschakeld voordat er een volgende poging gedaan kan worden.
Een kluis retourneren
De gebruiker staat voor de FUYL Tower om zijn/
haar opgeladen apparaat op te halen.
Voer het nummer van de kluis in waar het ap-
paraat opgeslagen is.
De kluis wordt ontgrendeld met de oorspronkelijk 
ingevoerde pincode.
De gebruiker kan het mobiele apparaat uit de 
kluis halen.
Het inbraakalarm kan opnieuw ingesteld worden door 
de beheersleutel te gebruiken om de ophengsmodus 
beheerders in te voeren. Raadpleeg het onderdeel 
Beheerder voor aanwijzingen. Zodra de beheermodus 
ingevoerd is vindt er een reset van het inbraakalarm plaats.

HANDLEIDING
BEHEEER
Een beheerder moet soms onderhoud uitvoeren of ace nemen als gevolg van:
1.  Gebruiker vergeet pincode
2.  Inbraakalarm kluis is ingeschakeld
3.  Kluisjes dienen leeggemaakt of schoongemaakt te worden.
De beheerder kan hiervoor de ophengsmodus beheerder gebruiken.
 
Toetsenbord ophengsmodus beheerders - Veriëren
Om de modus in te voeren dient de beheerder de toegangssleutel te gebruiken die verstrekt werd met de 
FUYL Tower. Draai de sleutel naar rechts en houd deze even vast.
Nadat de sleutel geacveerd is wordt de beheerder gevraagd om de 8-cijferige vericaecode. De standaard 
vericaecode is 23350743 maar deze moet uit veiligheidsoverwegingen zo snel mogelijk gewijzigd te worden.
Voer de 8-cijferige vericaecode in
Als men de vericaecode vergeet kan deze via de beheerportal van de FUYL Tower opnieuw ingesteld 
worden (netwerkverbinding vereist).
Raadpleeg de handleiding beheerportal. U kunt ook contact opnemen met PC Locs / LockNCharge. 
Opmerking: De vericaecode en het wachtwoord voor toegang tot de beheerportal van de FUYL Tower zijn 
verschillend.
Toetsenbord ophengsmodus beheerders - Veriëren
Nadat de vericae gelukt is worden er opes op het scherm weergegeven.
Opmerking: Als de stroom naar de FUYL Tower uitgevallen is en de deuren 
geopend moeten worden dient u het volgende onderdeel te raadplegen: 
MANUELE OPHEFFING DEUR
OPMERKING: Er worden meer opes weergegeven 
door de sleutelschakelaar meerdere keren te draaien.

Een kluis retourneren
Druk op 1 om één kluis te openen. Nadat de kluis 
geopend is blij deze geopend en wordt de oude 
pincode gewist.
Druk op 2 om alle kluisjes één voor één te 
openen. Alle kluisjes gaan open en alle pincodes 
worden gewist.
Draai de sleutelschakelaar naar rechts voor meer
opes.
Druk op 3 om de pincode beheerder veranderen. 
pincodes moeten bestaan uit 8-cijfers. De pin-
code moet twee keer ingevoerd worden. Druk op 
4 om de diagnose reeks te starten. Raadpleeg PC 
Locs / LocknCharge support voordat u dit doet.
Draai de sleutelschakelaar naar rechts voor meer
opes.
Deze opes zijn alleen relevant voor extern 
beheer. Raadpleeg de handleiding voor de FUYL 
Tower beheerportal.
MANUELE OPHEFFING DEUR
Dit kan uitgevoerd worden als er geen stroom beschikbaar is en de deuren geopend moeten worden.
OPMERKING: Met de manuele opheng worden alle 
deuren geopend. Het is NIET mogelijk om individuele 
deuren te openen.
Gebruik de onderhoudssleutel om de deur 
van het bedieningspaneel te openen.

HANDLEIDING
Steek de vrijgavehendel in de kast zoals weerge-
geven.
Druk de hendel stevig omhoog om alle deuren te 
openen.
Druk de hendel stevig omlaag voor een reset van 
de klink.
Verwijder de hendel en sluit en vergrendel de 
deur van het bedieningspaneel.
Nadat deze procedure uitgevoerd is wordt de staat van de kluisjes bepaald op het moment waarop de 
stroom weer ingeschakeld wordt. Kluisjes die manueel geopend werden en op het moment dat de stroom 
ingeschakeld werd open waren blijven openstaan (er wordt geen alarm geacveerd). Kluisjes die dicht 
waren op het moment dat de stroom ingeschakeld werd blijven dicht (alsof ze nooit geopend werden).
Bijvoorbeeld:
•  Kluis 5 is vergrendeld
•  De stroom valt uit
•  De manuele opheng wordt gebruikt om kluis 5 te openen
•  Als de stroom weer aangaat en de deur van kluis 5 is open wordt het inbraakalarm geacveerd. Gebruik 
de ophengsmodus beheerders om het alarm uit te schakelen, waarna de kluis klaar voor gebruik is.
•  Als de deur van kluis 5 vergrendeld wordt voordat de stroom weer ingeschakeld wordt blij deze kluis 
vergrendeld met dezelfde PIN als daarvoor.
BEHEERPORTAL
De FUYL Tower kan beheerd worden via een bekabeld lokaal netwerk of door rechtstreeks verbinding te 
maken met de FUYL Tower met een Ethernetkabel. Dit wordt uitgevoerd met een browser (Firefox, Explorer, 
Chrome, Safari).
Osite-beheer wordt niet ondersteund.
Er is een aparte handleiding voor de portal waarin de instellingen en gebruiksaanwijzingen behandeld
