Using BIOS setup 39
Using BIOS setup
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a layer of software, called 
firmware, that translates instructions from other layers of 
software into instructions that the Joybook Lite hardware can 
understand. The BIOS settings are needed by the Joybook Lite 
to identify the types of installed devices and establish special 
features.
When and how to use BIOS 
setup
You need to use BIOS setup when:
• You see an error message on the screen requesting you to run 
BIOS setup.
• You want to restore the factory default settings.
• You want to modify some specific settings according to the 
hardware.
• You want to modify some specific settings to optimize system 
performance.
To run BIOS setup, press the <F2> key immediately when the 
BenQ logo appears on the screen during system startup. The 
logo shows up on the screen for only a few seconds, so you must 
press the <F2> key at the time.
BIOS settings are specific to your Joybook Lite hardware. Do 
NOT change existing BIOS settings unless you are sure they 
need to be changed, and are aware of the consequences. Any 
incorrect BIOS settings may degrade the performance, 
operation and functionality of your Joybook Lite.
For latest BIOS updates, visit http://www.benq.com/support/.
• The BIOS setup screen shown in this chapter is for your 
reference only. The actual items or settings on your Joybook 
Lite may differ.
• The BIOS setup program may have been updated after the 
publication of this manual.
• The settings you select in your operating system might 
override similar settings in BIOS setup.

Recovering your system using QDataTrove42
Recovering your system using QDataTrove
Introduction to QDataTrove
Your Joybook Lite may come pre-installed with QDataTrove 
depending on your purchased model. QDataTrove is an 
application that allows you to back up your system, restore your 
system, or burn system image and bundled applications/drivers 
into discs. In QDataTrove, the following three functional 
modules are available:
• 
Back up: This function allows you to back up your system 
drive into a single image file, back up your system drive into 
discs, or manually create a restore point. For details, refer to 
"Backing up your system" on page 43.
• 
Restore: This function helps you recover your system with 
factory default system image or your own backup system 
image, when the system is abnormal or damaged. It also allows 
you to restore your system from a restore point, or reinstall 
bundled applications and drivers. For details, refer to 
"Restoring your system" on page 45.
• 
Create Discs: This function allows you to create recovery 
discs from factory default system image or your own backup 
system image. It also allows you to back up all bundled 
applications and drivers into a disc. In addition, you can create 
a bootable USB flash disk. For details, refer to "Creating 
recovery discs or Application and Driver DVD" on page 46.
• QDataTrove works on factory-installed Windows operating 
systems only.
• It is strongly recommended to create Factory Recovery DVD 
immediately once your Joybook Lite is ready for use. Refer 
to "Creating a Factory Recovery CD/DVD" on page 46 for 
details.
• For the reasons below, you may not be able to restore your 
system using QDataTrove:
a. On your Joybook Lite, the hidden partition in which 
the QDataTrove files are saved has been changed.
b. Your operating system is not pre-installed by the 
manufacturer.
You can use the Factory Recovery CD/DVD created (page 
46) to restore the system. If you do not have the Factory 
Recovery CD/DVD, please contact the BenQ Customer 
Service for assistance. Extra charge may be required if 
necessary.
• QDataTrove is not intended for backing up personal files, so 
it cannot help you recover a personal file that has been 
damaged or deleted. You should regularly back up your 
personal files and important data using a backup program.
• System recovery is a data destructive process. It is strongly 
recommended to back up all important data and applications 
prior to performing the operation.
• Make sure your system is connected to AC Power before 
using QDataTrove.

Protecting your Joybook Lite 
from viruses and other 
security threats
Your Joybook Lite may come pre-installed with an anti-virus 
software, which can help you avoid unexpected destruction of 
your precious data in the Joybook Lite and keeps your privacy 
against any unauthorized access from other computers.
The anti-virus software protects your computer against Internet 
threats, such as viruses, Spyware, hackers, and spam. In 
addition, you can secure your personal information, block 
unwanted web sites, and check e-mail for viruses.
However, we would still recommend that you back up your data 
regularly on CDs, DVDs, or other external storage device, since 
the anti-virus software may not be able to intercept all existing 
and new viruses, which may lead to destruction of all or some of 
your data in the Joybook Lite.
Furthermore, it is also recommended to set Windows to 
automatically install important updates for your Joybook Lite. 
Important updates can bring you significant benefits, such as 
improved security and reliability.
For more information about how to use the anti-virus software 
installed, refer to the online help that comes with the software.

FAQ and troubleshooting 55
FAQ and troubleshooting
The chapter describes situations that you may encounter during 
use of the Joybook Lite, along with basic troubleshooting steps. 
If you are not able to resolve the issue, contact a nearest BenQ 
service center for assistance immediately.
Battery and power
How long should I charge the battery for the first time?
The length of the charging time may vary. When the amber light 
of the battery indicator goes off, it means that the battery is fully 
charged.
Alternatively, check the battery icon in the notification area 
located in the lower right corner of the desktop to see if the 
battery is fully charged.
My Joybook Lite won't start up with the battery inserted. What 
should I do?
• Make sure the battery is properly inserted.
• Make sure the battery is fully charged. If this does not work, 
consult your BenQ dealer.
What should I do with the battery if I will not use my Joybook 
Lite for a long time?
Recharge the battery or discharge it to about 40% full, and then 
store it in a dry place at about 15°C to 25°C. Extremely high or 
low temperature will shorten the battery life.
The battery icon in the notification area on my Joybook Lite 
suggests that the battery is fully charged. However, when I check 
it from the Power Manager in Windows, the battery level is only 
about 95%-99%. Why?
It is the result of the battery protection design of your Joybook 
Lite. When the battery indicator on your Joybook Lite goes off, 
it means that the battery has reached a saturated voltage: 
95%~99%. At this moment, the voltage difference detected by 
your Joybook Lite is very small, so it will reduce the charging 
current to prevent overcharging the battery with excess current 
or voltage, which will damage the battery. Moreover, in order to 
protect the battery from exposing to high voltage and current 
for a long time during charging, the battery has been equipped 
with a protection circuit that will charge the battery at low 
current in the final phase.

FAQ and troubleshooting56
How come my notebook is not fully charged even after a full 
night charge?
Make sure the Joybook Lite is receiving power. Is the power cord 
plugged in correctly? If the battery is installed in the Joybook 
Lite and it is properly connected to an AC outlet, check if the 
battery meter icon is showing a charge sign. If this does not fix 
the problem, then the battery, the power source in your Joybook 
Lite, or the AC power cord may be defective. Consult your BenQ 
dealer for help and maintenance.
What should I do if the battery gets hot in my Joybook Lite?
Take the battery out and let it cool down for a while. If the 
problem persists when the battery is inserted again into your 
Joybook Lite later, the battery could be defective and it may 
need to be replaced. Consult your BenQ dealer for help and 
maintenance.
I have pressed the Power button, but my Joybook Lite cannot 
start up.
Check the Power button indicator.
• If it is not lit up, your Joybook Lite is not being supplied by 
power, either from an external power source via the power 
adapter or from the battery pack. Make sure you have 
connected the power adapter correctly to the power jack of 
your Joybook Lite and a working electrical outlet, so the 
battery can start charging.
• If the Power button indicator lights up in blue, the 
Joybook Lite is being supplied normally with power, 
meaning that the problem lies elsewhere.
• If you have added or replaced any hardware, such as a 
memory module, check if it has been installed 
correctly.
• It is possible that certain operating system files are 
damaged or missing. If so, you may need to back up all 
your data first, and then recover your system. Refer to 
"Recovering your system using QDataTrove" on page 
42 for details.
Why does the battery on my Joybook Lite seem to last shorter 
and shorter?
It is normal for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries to decline in 
capacity over time.
Connection
What is a Wireless LAN (WLAN)?
A WLAN is a type of Local Area Network (LAN) that uses high 
frequency radio waves rather than wires to communicate and 
transmit data among nodes. It is a flexible data communication 
system implemented as an extension to, or as an alternative for, 
a wired LAN within a building or campus.
I cannot connect to the Internet with the built-in network 
interface on my Joybook Lite. Why?
Check if the network has a fixed MAC address. Contact your 
network administrator for further solutions.

System
How should I resolve the "Low on Disk Space" or "Out of Disk 
Space" error messages?
Windows uses disk space for operations, such as caching and 
virtual memory. The Joybook Lite may not run reliably if the 
free space of the hard disk drops under 100MB or 200MB. The 
following instructions will help you free up the disk space.
1. Click 
Start > My Computer.
2. Right-click the hard disk icon and then select 
Properties.
3. Observe how much free space is on the hard disk.
4. To free up the space of your hard disk, click 
Disk Cleanup 
and follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.
How do I update the driver?
Please visit BenQ Online Service and Support 
(http://www.benq.com/support/) to search for driver updates.
My system is running very slow. How can I improve the 
performance?
System resources are the amount of memory and hard disk 
space that your Joybook Lite can use, which may degrade over

time and affect the system performance. However, you can still 
improve the system performance by using the methods below: 
• Close all open programs not being used. Use software 
programs that are absolutely necessary. Try running virus 
scans and other tools when you are not using your Joybook 
Lite. Closing software programs that are not necessary helps 
your system performs more efficiently.
• Prevent background software programs from loading. As 
software programs load the small icons in the notification area 
located in the lower right corner of the desktop, they will be 
running in the background and each one consumes valuable 
system resources. You can follow the steps below to prevent 
application programs from running when Windows launches:
1. Press  + R to display the 
Run dialog box.
2. Type "msconfig" in the 
Open field. The system 
configuration utility will appears.
3. Click the 
Startup tab, and then uncheck any task that 
is unwanted.
4. Click 
Apply > OK. Restart your Joybook Lite.
• Remove programs from the Startup folder. Removing 
programs from the Startup folder also helps prevent programs 
from running when Windows starts up. To do so, follow the 
steps below:
1. Right-click anywhere in the open area on the desktop 
and select 
New > Folder. Give the folder a name. This 
folder will be used later.
2. Right-click the 
Start button and then select Open. A

in the 
Startup folder. Select unwanted program icons, 
right-click on them and select 
Cut.
6. Close the open windows to return to the desktop.
7. Open the folder created in Step 1.
8. Select the 
Edit and Paste commands in the folder 
window. The icons that were cut from the 
Startup 
folder are now placed in the folder.
9. Restart the Joybook Lite. The programs removed from 
the 
Startup folder will no longer run when Windows 
starts. However, you can still run them by double-
clicking their icons in the folder created in Step 1.
• Empty the 
Recycle Bin. You can free up disk space by clearing 
files you no longer need from the 
Recycle Bin. To do so, 
right-click the 
Recycle Bin icon on the desktop and select 
Empty Recycle Bin.
• Delete temporary files and directories. This will increase the 
disk space of your hard disk, and reduce the time Windows

Why does the keyboard and/or palm rest get warm?
Typically, the Joybook Lite tends to be warm slightly. The 
location of the hard disk is typically underneath the palm rest 
and as a result, the palm rest gets warm. The location of the 
processor is typically underneath the keyboard. And since the 
heat rises, the keyboard may get warm slightly. Since your 
Joybook Lite has a thermally controlled fan, when the CPU and/
or internal temperature of the Joybook Lite reaches a certain 
temperature level, the fan is turned ON and stays ON until the 
temperature drops to a pre-defined level.
There is no sound coming from the speakers.
Verif y the f ollow ing:
• The speakers may have been muted. Check the volume control 
(speaker icon) in the notification area located in the lower 
JBL_U105 UM EN.book  Page 59  Thursday, December 9, 2010  4:16 PM

FAQ and troubleshooting60
right corner of the desktop to see if the volume has been 
muted. If so, please restore the volume.
• The speakers may have been turned off. Use the <Fn> + <F6> 
hotkey combination to turn them on.
• The volume may have been set too low. Use the <Fn> + <F8> 
hotkey combination to increase the volume.
• An earphone or external speakers may have been connected to 
the audio output jack, turning off the Joybook Lite's built-in 
speakers automatically.
Why is the hard disk capacity displayed by the OS different from 
its nominated capacity?
You may have discovered that the capacity of a 10GB hard disk 
becomes 9GB when displayed from the OS, and 20GB becomes 
19GB, etc. The bigger the capacity, the bigger the difference. It is 
because hard disk manufacturers and OS developers calculate 
hard disk capacity in different ways. As a result, the nominated 
capacity is different from the exact capacity displayed by the OS.
Example of a 40GB hard disk:
Exact capacity of a 40GB hard disk displayed in the OS:
40,000,000,000÷1024÷1024÷1024=37.2529 (GB).
Furthermore, when a hard disk is partitioned, the system will 
reserve some space on the drive for system files. Therefore, the 
total capacity of a hard disk displayed by the OS will never be 
the same as its nominated capacity.
I hear noise when connecting an earphone to the Joybook Lite.
Verify t h e followi n g:
• Connect the earphone to other devices, such as a radio to see if 
you can still hear that noise. If the noise persists, the earphone 
may be out of order.
• If you can hear the noise only when inserting, it is the result of 
high instantaneous current. It is a normal phenomenon.

FAQ and troubleshooting 61
How can I reduce the wearing of the screen hinge when I lift up 
the lid of my Joybook Lite?
Please open/close the lid gently and slowly with both hands. 
Apply force evenly on both hands to reduce hinge wearing and 
prevent deformation or breaking of hinge due to uneven force.
What should I do if a program in Windows freezes?
If your system freezes, press the <Ctrl> + <Alt> + <Del> keys 
simultaneously, click 
Start Task Manager. Under Windows 
Task Manager, click the Applications tab, and then click on 
the application that freezes and click 
End Task.
Why is my Joybook Lite running so hot? Is it normal?
Yes. Because all the hardware is in such cramped quarters, it 
tends to get hot. To prevent overheating, do not obstruct the 
vents. For example, do not use the Joybook Lite in bed where a 
blanket may inadvertently cover the vents and block the airflow.
Why does my Joybook Lite seem to turn off itself after a certain 
period of inactivity?
This is the default setting of the Joybook Lite to conserve battery 
power. The Joybook Lite is configured to use the power saving 
feature. You can go to 
Start > Control Panel > Performance 
and Maintenance
 > Power Options to select your preferred 
power plan.
Should I drain the battery of my Joybook Lite every time before 
charging to retain its capacity?
No. Your Joybook Lite comes with an Lithium-ion (Li-ion) 
battery pack. This is one of the newest cell types available. It is 
also the lightest battery type currently available on a 
commercial basis and can provide more power than other main 
cell types. There are no known problems of memory effect with 
this battery type and it is the easiest battery type to be 
maintained.
Display
There is nothing visible on the screen.
Check the Power button indicator.
• If it is not lit up, no power is being supplied to the Joybook 
Lite. Connect the power adapter and restart the Joybook Lite.
• If it blinks in amber, the Joybook Lite has entered Sleep mode 
in order to conserve power. You can press the Power button to 
resume from Sleep mode.
• If it lights up in blue, the Joybook Lite is being supplied 
normally with power. There are two possible causes for the 
problem.
• The screen's brightness may have been set too low. Use 
the <Fn> + <F5> hotkey combination to increase the 
brightness.
• The display may have been switched to use an 
connected external display device. Use the <Fn> + 
<F3> hotkey combination to switch the display back 
to the Joybook Lite or to use simultaneous display.

FAQ and troubleshooting62
When I connect the Joybook Lite to an external monitor, the 
display is abnormal.
The instructions below will guide you through the 
troubleshooting process.
• Use the <Fn> + <F3> function key combination to make 
external video signal enabled.
• Refer to the user manual that came with the external monitor 
to check the settings.
• Connect the VGA cable to the Joybook Lite and reboot the 
system. If there is no display on the external monitor after 
system reboot, connect the Joybook Lite to a standard VGA 
monitor, and wait until you can see things properly on that 
VGA monitor. Then, connect the target display to the Joybook 
Lite again.
How can I judge if my LCD panel is out of order and what 
should I do if this happens?
If your Joybook Lite cannot display images at the default 
resolution, please visit the BenQ web site to download and 
update the latest Joybook Lite display drivers.
Contact your BenQ dealer if you encounter the following 
situations:
• The screen flickers when the system starts up normally.
• Fonts displayed on the screen are unclear and strange codes 
appear.
• There is no display when the hard disk is running normally.
• Colors on the screen are strange and turn into white.
• Vertical or horizontal lines appear on the screen.
• When playing a media file using Windows Media Player, the 
frame speed is abnormal.
• The sound changes while the screen remains the same when 
playing games.
