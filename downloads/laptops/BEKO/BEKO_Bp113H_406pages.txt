1.6 No ignition sources
No person carrying out work in relation to a refrigeration system 
which involves exposing any pipe work that contains or has 
contained flammable refrigerant shall use any sources of ignition 
in such a manner that it may lead to the risk of fire or explosion. 
Allpossible ignition sources, including cigarette smoking, should 
be kept sufficiently far away from the site of installation, repairing, 
removing and disposal, during which flammable refrigerant can 
possibly be released to the surrounding space. Prior to work taking 
place, the area around the equipment is to be surveyed to make sure 
that there are no flammable hazards or ignition risks. “No Smoking” 
signs shall be displayed.
1.7  Ventilated area
Ensure that the area is in the open or that it is adequately ventilated 
before breaking into the system or conducting any hot work.

15 / 396 EN
1.8 Checks to the refrigeration equipment
Where electrical components are being changed, they shall be fit 
for the purpose and to the correct specification. At all times the 
manufacturer’s maintenance and service guidelines shall be followed. 
If in doubt consult the manufacturer’s technical department for 
assistance. The following checks shall be applied to installations using 
flammable refrigerants: the charge size is in accordance with the 
room size within which the refrigerant containing parts are installed; 
the ventilation machinery and outlets are operating adequately and 
are not obstructed; if an indirect refrigerating circuit is being used, 
the secondary circuit shall be checked for the presence of refrigerant; 
marking to the equipment continues to be visible and legible. Markings 
and signs that are illegible shall be corrected; refrigeration pipe or 
components are installed in a position where they are unlikely to be 
exposed to any substance which may corrode refrigerant containing 
components, unless the components are constructed of materials 
which are inherently resistant to being corroded or are suitably 
protected against being so corroded.
1.9 Checks to electrical devices
Repair and maintenance to electrical components shall include 
initial safety checks and component inspection procedures. If afault 
exists that could compromise safety, then no electrical supply 
shall be connected to the circuit until it is satisfactorily dealt with. 
If the fault cannot be corrected immediately but it is necessary to 
continue operation, an adequate temporary solution shall be used. 
This shall be reported to the owner of the equipment so all parties 
are advised.
1  Safety awareness

--- Page 16 ---
16 / 396 EN

Initial safety checks shall include: that capacitors are discharged: this 
shall be done in a safe manner to avoid possibility of sparking; that 
there no live electrical components and wiring are exposed while 
charging, recovering or purging the system; that there is continuity 
of earth bonding.
2. Repairs to sealed components
2.1  During repairs to sealed components, all electrical supplies shall 
be disconnected from the equipment being worked upon prior 
to any removal of sealed covers, etc. If it is absolutely necessary 
to have an electrical supply to equipment during servicing, then 
a permanently operating form of leak detection shall be located 
at the most critical point to warn of a potentially hazardous 
situation.
2.2 Particular attention shall be paid to the following to ensure that 
by working on electrical components, the casing is not altered 
in such a way that the level of protection is affected. This shall 
include damage to cables, excessive number of connections, 
terminals not made to original specification, damage to seals, 
incorrect fitting of glands, etc. Ensure that apparatus is 
mounted securely. Ensure that seals or sealing materials have 
not degraded such that they no longer serve the purpose of 
preventing the ingress of flammable atmospheres. Replacement 
parts shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
specifications.

C
Note: 
The use of silicon sealant may inhibit the 
effectiveness of some types of leak detection equipment. 
Intrinsically safe components do not have to be isolated 
prior to working on them.
3. Repair to intrinsically safe components
Do not apply any permanent inductive or capacitance loads to the 
circuit without ensuring that this will not exceed the permissible 
voltage and current permitted for the equipment in use.
Intrinsically safe components are the only types that can be worked 
on while live in the presence of a flammable atmosphere. The test 
apparatus shall be at the correct rating. Replace components only 
with parts specified by the manufacturer. Other parts may result in 
the ignition of refrigerant in the atmosphere from a leak.
4. Cabling
Check that cabling will not be subject to wear, corrosion, excessive 
pressure, vibration, sharp edges or any other adverse environmental 
effects. The check shall also take into account the effects of aging 
or continual vibration from sources such as compressors or fans.
5. Detection of flammable refrigerants
Under no circumstances shall potential sources of ignition be used 
in the searching for or detection of refrigerant leaks. A halide torch 
(or any other detector using a naked flame) shall not be used.
1  Safety awareness

--- Page 18 ---
18 / 396 EN
Local Air-conditioner / User Manual
6. Leak detection methods
The following leak detection methods are deemed acceptable 
for systems containing flammable refrigerants. Electronic leak 
detectors shall be used to detect flammable refrigerants, but 
the sensitivity may not be adequate, or may need recalibration. 
(Detection equipment shall be calibrated in a refrigerant-free 
area.) Ensure that the detector is not a potential source of ignition 
and is suitable for the refrigerant used. Leak detection equipment 
shall be set at a percentage of the LFL of the refrigerant and shall 
be calibrated to the refrigerant employed and the appropriate 
percentage of gas (25% maximum) is confirmed. Leak detection 
fluids are suitable for use with most refrigerants but the use of 
detergents containing chlorine shall be avoided as the chlorine may 
react with the refrigerant and corrode the copper pipe-work. If a 
leak is suspected, all naked flames shall be removed/extinguished. 
If a leakage of refrigerant is found which requires brazing, all of 
the refrigerant shall be recovered from the system, or isolated (by 
means of shut off valves) in a part of the system remote from the 
leak. Oxygen free nitrogen (OFN) shall then be purged through the 
system both before and during the brazing process.
1  Safety awareness

Local Air-conditioner / User Manual
19 / 396 EN
7. Removal and evacuation
When breaking into the refrigerant circuit to make repairs – or for any 
other purpose – con-ventional procedures shall be used.However, 
it is important that best practice is followed since flammability is a 
consideration. The following procedure shall be adhered to: remove 
refrigerant; purge the circuit with inert gas; evacuate; purge again 
with inert gas; open the circuit by cutting or brazing. The refrigerant 
charge shall be recovered into the correct recovery cylinders. The 
system shall be “flushed” with OFN to render the unit safe. This 
process may need to be repeated several times. Compressed air or 
oxygen shall not be used for this task. Flushing shall be achieved by 
breaking the vacuum in the system with OFN and continuing to fill 
until the working pressure is achieved, then venting to atmosphere, 
and finally pulling down to a vacuum. This process shall be repeated 
until no refrigerant is within the system. When the final OFN charge 
is used, the system shall be vented down to atmospheric pressure to 
enable work to take place. This operation is absolutely vital if brazing 
operations on the pipework are to take place.
Ensure that the outlet for the vacuum pump is not close to any 
ignition sources and there is ventilation available.
8. Charging procedures
In addition to conventional charging procedures, the following 
requirements shall be followed.
 -
Ensure that contamination of different refrigerants does not occur 
when using charging equipment. Hoses or lines shall be as short as 
possible to minimise the amount of refrigerant contained in them.
1  Safety awareness

--- Page 20 ---
20 / 396 EN
Local Air-conditioner / User Manual
 -
Cylinders shall be kept upright.
 -
Ensure that the refrigeration system is earthed prior to charging 
the system with refrigerant.
 -
Label the system when charging is complete (if not already).
 -
Extreme care shall be taken not to overfill the refrigeration 
system.
Prior to recharging the system it shall be pressure tested with OFN. 
The system shall be leak tested on completion of charging but prior 
to commissioning. A follow up leak test shall be carried out prior to 
leaving the site.
9. Decommissioning
Before carrying out this procedure, it is essential that the technician 
is completely familiar with the equipment and all its detail. It is 
recommended good practice that all refrigerants are recovered 
safely. Prior to the task being carried out, an oil and refrigerant 
sample shall be taken in case analysis is required prior to re-use of 
reclaimed refrigerant. It is essential that electrical power is available 
before the task is commenced. 
a) Become familiar with the equipment and its operation.
b) Isolate system electrically.
c)  Before attempting the procedure ensure that: mechanical 
handling equipment is available, if required, for handling 
refrigerant cylinders; all personal protective equipment is 
available and being used correctly; the recovery process 
is supervised at all times by a competent person; recovery 
equipment and cylinders conform to the appropriate standards.
1  Safety awareness

--- Page 21 ---
Local Air-conditioner / User Manual
21 / 396 EN
d) Pump down refrigerant system,if possible.
e) If a vacuum is not possible, make a manifold so that refrigerant 
can be removed from various parts of the system.
f)  Make sure that cylinder is situated on the scales before 
recovery takes place.
g) Start the recovery machine and operate in accordance with 
manufacturer’s instructions.
h) Do not overfill cylinders. (No more than 80 % volume liquid 
charge).
i)  Do not exceed the maximum working pressure of the 
cylinder,even temporarily.
j)  When the cylinders have been filled correctly and the process 
completed, make sure that the cylinders and the equipment 
are removed from site promptly and all isolation valves on the 
equipment are closed off.
k)  Recovered refrigerant shall not be charged into another 
refrigeration system unless it has been cleaned and checked.
10.  Labelling
Equipment shall be labelled stating that it has been de-
commissioned and emptied of refrigerant.The label shall be dated 
and signed.
Ensure that there are labels on the equipment stating the 
equipment contains flammable refrigerant.
1  Safety awareness

22 / 396 EN
Local Air-conditioner / User Manual
11.  Recovery
When removing refrigerant from a system, either for servicing 
or decommissioning, it is recommended good practice that all 
refrigerants are removed safely. When transferring refrigerant 
into cylinders, ensure that only appropriate refrigerant recovery 
cylinders are employed. Ensure that the correct number of cylinders 
for holding the total system charge are available. All cylinders to be 
used are designated for the recovered refrigerant and labelled for 
that refrigerant (i.e. special cylinders for the recovery of refrigerant). 
Cylinders shall be complete with pressure relief valve and associated 
shut-off valves in good working order. Empty recovery cylinders are

à une utilisation avec des réfrigérants inflammables, c’est-à-dire sans 
étincelles, étanchéifié de façon adéquate ou intrinsèquement sûr.
1.5  Présence d’un extincteur d’incendie
Si un travail à chaud est mené sur l’équipement de réfrigération 
ou des pièces associées, un équipement d’extinction d’incendie 
approprié doit être à portée de main. Un extincteur à poudre ou au 
CO
2
 doit être disponible à proximité de la zone de chargement.
1.6 Pas de sources d’allumage
Personne n’effectuant un travail lié à un système de réfrigération 
impliquant l’exposition de tuyauterie contenant ou ayant contenu 
un réfrigérant inflammable ne doit utiliser de sources d’allumage 
de façon à ce que cela puisse provoquer un risque d’incendie ou 
d’explosion. Toutes les sources d’allumage possibles, y compris la 
fumée de cigarette, doivent rester à une distance suffisante du 
site d’installation, de réparation, d’enlèvement et de mise au rebut, 
durant lesquels un gaz réfrigérant inflammable peut potentiellement 
être libéré dans l’espace environnant. Avant le début du travail, la 
zone autour de l’équipement doit être étudiée pour s’assurer qu’il n’y 
a pas de danger inflammable ni de risque d’allumage. Des pancartes 
«Interdiction de fumer» doivent être installées.

1.7  Zone aérée
Vérifiez que la zone est en plein air ou aérée correctement avant 
d’ouvrir le système ou d’effectuer un travail à chaud. Un certain 
niveau d’aération doit se poursuivre pendant la réalisation du travail. 
La ventilation doit disperser en toute sécurité tout réfrigérant libéré 
et de préférence l’expulser de façon externe dans l’atmosphère.
1.8 Vérifications sur l’équipement de réfrigération
Si des composants électriques sont en cours de changement, 
ils doivent convenir à cet usage et à la bonne spécification. Les 
instructions de maintenance et d’entretien du fabricant doivent 
toujours être suivies. En cas de doute, consultez le service technique 
du constructeur pour obtenir une assistance. Vous devez effectuer 
les contrôles suivants sur les installations utilisant des réfrigérants 
inflammables: le volume de la charge correspond à la taille du local 
dans lequel les pièces contenant le réfrigérant sont installées; le 
mécanisme de ventilation et les sorties fonctionnent correctement 
et ne sont pas obstrués; si un circuit de réfrigération indirect est 
utilisé, la présence de réfrigérant doit être vérifiée dans le circuit 
secondaire; le marquage sur l’équipement continue d’être visible et 
lisible. Les marquages et les signaux illisibles doivent être corrigés; 
les tuyaux ou composants de réfrigération sont installés dans un 
endroit où il est peu probable qu’ils soient exposés à une substance 
susceptible de corroder des pièces contenant du réfrigérant, 
à moins qu’elles ne soient construites dans des matériaux qui 
sont intrinsèquement résistants à la corrosion ou qui sont 
convenablement protégés contre celle-ci.

1.9 Vérifications sur les dispositifs électriques
Les réparations et la maintenance des composants électriques 
doivent inclure des vérifications de sécurité initiales et des 
procédures d’inspection des composants. S’il y a une défaillance 
pouvant compromettre la sécurité, alors aucune alimentation 
électrique ne doit être raccordée au circuit tant que ce problème 
n’est pas résolu de façon satisfaisante. Si le défaut ne peut pas être 
corrigé dans l’immédiat mais qu’il faut continuer les opérations, une 
solution adaptée sera utilisée provisoirement. Cela doit être signalé 
au propriétaire de l’équipement de façon à ce que toutes les parties 
soient informées.
Les contrôles de sécurité initiaux doivent inclure ce qui suit: vérifier 
que les condenseurs sont déchargés (cela doit être fait de manière 
sûre pour éviter la possibilité d’étincelles); vérifier qu’il n’y a pas 
de composants électriques sous tension et de câblage exposés 
pendant la charge, la récupération ou la purge du système; vérifier 
qu’il y a une continuité de la mise à la terre.
2. Réparations sur les composants hermétiques
2.1  Lors des réparations de composants hermétiques, toutes 
les alimentations électriques doivent être déconnectées de 
l’équipement sur lequel les techniciens travaillent avant le 
démontage de couvercles hermétiques, etc. Étant donné qu’il faut 
absolument avoir une alimentation électrique sur l’équipement 
durant l’entretien, une forme opérationnelle permanente de 
détection de fuite doit être située au point le plus critique pour 
signaler une situation potentiellement dangereuse.

2.2 Soyez particulièrement attentif à ce qui suit pour s’assurer qu’un 
travail sur des composants électriques n’altérerait pas le boîtier 
d’une façon qui affecterait le niveau de protection. Cela comprend 
les dommages aux câbles, le nombre excessif de branchements, 
les bornes non conformes aux spécifications d’origine, les 
dommages aux joints, le mauvais montage des presse-étoupes, 
etc. Assurez-vous que l’appareil est bien monté. Vérifiez que 
les joints ou les matériaux isolants ne se sont pas dégradés à 
un tel point qu’ils ne servent plus à empêcher la pénétration 
d’atmosphères inflammables. Les pièces de rechange doivent être 
conformes aux spécifications du fabricant. 
C
Remarque: 
L'utilisation de produit d'étanchéité en 
silicone peut inhiber l’efficacité de certains types de 
matériel de détection des fuites. Les composants 
intrinsèquement sûrs n’ont pas besoin d’être isolés avant 
que quelqu'un travaille dessus.
3. Réparation des composants de sécurité intrinsèque
N’appliquez pas de charges inductives ou capacitives permanentes 
au circuit sans vous assurer que cela ne dépassera pas la tension 
permise et l’intensité permise pour l’équipement en utilisation.
Les composants intrinsèquement sûrs sont les seuls types sur lesquels 
quelqu’un peut travailler quand ils sont sous tension en présence d’une 
atmosphère inflammable. L’appareillage d’essai doit avoir les bonnes 
caractéristiques nominales. Remplacez les composants uniquement par 
des pièces spécifiées par le fabricant. D’autres pièces peuvent provoquer 
l’allumage du réfrigérant dans l’atmosphère à partir d’une fuite.

4. Câblage
Vérifiez que le câblage ne sera pas sujet à l’usure, la corrosion, une 
pression excessive, des vibrations, des bords coupants ou d’autres 
intempéries. La vérification doit également prendre en compte les 
effets du vieillissement ou des vibrations constantes de sources 
telles que des compresseurs ou des ventilateurs.
5. Détection de réfrigérants inflammables
Sous aucun prétexte, des sources d’allumage potentielles ne doivent 
être utilisées dans la recherche ou pour la détection de fuites de 
réfrigérant. N’utilisez pas une lampe haloïde (ou un autre détecteur 
utilisant une flamme nue).
6. Méthodes de détection des fuites
Les méthodes de détection de fuite suivantes sont jugées 
acceptables pour des systèmes contenant des réfrigérants 
inflammables. Des dispositifs électroniques de détection de 
fuite seront utilisés pour détecter les réfrigérants inflammables, 
toutefois la sensibilité de l’appareil pourrait ne pas être adaptée, ou 
il faudrait éventuellement réétalonner l’appareil. (L’équipement de 
détection sera étalonné dans une zone exempte de gaz réfrigérant.) 
Assurez-vous que le détecteur n’est pas une source potentielle 
d’inflammation et qu’il est adapté au type de réfrigérant utilisé. Le 
matériel de détection de fuite doit être réglé à un pourcentage du 
LFL du réfrigérant et doit être étalonné selon le réfrigérant employé 
et le pourcentage approprié de gaz (25% maximum) est confirmé. 
Des liquides de détection de fuite conviennent à une utilisation avec 
la plupart des réfrigérants, mais il faut éviter d’utiliser de détergents

1  Consignes de sécurité
contenant du chlorure, car le chlorure peut réagir avec le réfrigérant 
et corroder la tuyauterie en cuivre. En cas de suspicion de fuite, 
toutes les flammes nues doivent être éliminées/éteintes. Si une 
fuite de réfrigérant est décelée et nécessite un brasage, tout le 
réfrigérant doit être récupéré hors du système, ou isolé  
(par des vannes d’arrêt) dans une partie du système loin de la fuite. 
De l’azote exempt d’oxygène (OFN) doit ensuite être utilisé pour 
purger le système avant et pendant le procédé de brasage.
7. Enlèvement et évacuation
En accédant au circuit de réfrigérant pour effectuer des réparations, 
ou à toute autre fin, il faut suivre des procédures conventionnelles. 
Toutefois, il est important de suivre les meilleures pratiques, 
car l’inflammabilité est un facteur à prendre en considération. Il 
faut suivre la procédure suivante: enlever le fluide frigorigène; 
purger le circuit avec du gaz inerte; évacuer, purger à nouveau 
avec du gaz inerte; ouvrir le circuit par découpe ou brasage. La 
charge de réfrigérant doit être récupérée dans les bouteilles de 
récupération appropriées. Le système doit être rincé avec de 
l’azote exempt d’oxygène pour rendre l’unité sûre. Ce processus 
peut devoir être répété plusieurs fois. Il ne faut pas utiliser d’air 
comprimé ou d’oxygène pour cette tâche. Le rinçage doit être 
accompli en rompant le vide dans le système avec de l’azote exempt 
d’oxygène et en continuant de remplir jusqu’à atteindre la pression 
opérationnelle, puis en éventant à l’atmosphère, et enfin en créant 
un vide. Ce procédé doit être répété jusqu’à ce qu’il ne reste plus 
de réfrigérant dans le système. Quand une charge d’azote exempt 
d’oxygène est utilisée, le système doit être ventilé à la pression

atmosphérique pour permettre l’exécution des travaux. Cette 
opération est absolument vitale si des opérations de brasage 
doivent avoir lieu sur la tuyauterie.
Vérifiez que la sortie pour la pompe à vide n’est pas fermée 
pour aucune source d’allumage et vérifiez si une ventilation est 
disponible.
8. Procédure de chargement
En plus des procédures de chargement conventionnelles, les 
exigences suivantes doivent être suivies.
 -
Vérifiez que la contamination des différents réfrigérants ne se 
produit pas lors de l’utilisation d’équipement de chargement. Les 
tuyaux ou les conduites doivent être aussi courts que possible afin de 
réduire au minimum la quantité de réfrigérant qu’elles contiennent.
 -
Les bouteilles doivent rester debout.
 -
Vérifiez que le système de réfrigération est mis à la terre avant de 
charger le système avec du réfrigérant.
 -
Étiquetez le système lorsque le chargement est terminé  
(si ce n’est pas déjà fait).
 -
Soyez extrêmement prudent pour que le système de réfrigération 
ne déborde pas.
Avant de recharger le système, testez sa pression avec de l’azote 
exempt d’oxygène. Faites un essai d’étanchéité sur le système à la 
fin du chargement et avant la mise en service. Un essai d’étanchéité 
de suivi doit être effectué avant de quitter le site.

9. Mise hors service
Avant d’effectuer cette procédure, il est essentiel que le technicien soit 
complètement familiarisé avec l’équipement et tous ses détails. Il est 
recommandé et de bonne pratique de récupérer tous les réfrigérants 
en toute sécurité. Avant de réaliser l’opération, un échantillon d’huile 
et de réfrigérant sera prélevé lorsqu’une analyse est requise avant de 
réutiliser le réfrigérant récupéré. Il est essentiel qu’une alimentation 
électrique soit disponible avant de commencer la tâche. 
a) Familiarisez-vous avec l’équipement et son fonctionnement.
b) Isolez le système électriquement.
c)  Avant d’essayer la procédure, assurez-vous que: un équipement 
de manutention mécanique est disponible, si nécessaire, pour 
manipuler les bouteilles de réfrigérant; tous les équipements de 
protection individuelle sont disponibles et utilisés correctement; 
le processus de récupération est supervisé à tout moment par 
une personne compétente; l’équipement et les bouteilles de 
récupération sont conformes aux normes appropriées.
d) Pompez le système de réfrigérant vers le bas, si possible.
e) Si une aspiration n’est pas possible, faites un collecteur afin de 
pouvoir enlever le réfrigérant de diverses pièces du système.
f)  Vérifiez que la bouteille se situe sur la balance avant de 
commencer la récupération.
g) Démarrez la machine de récupération et utilisez-la 
conformément aux instructions du fabricant.
h) Ne remplissez pas excessivement les bouteilles. (Pas plus de 
80% du volume de chargement de liquide).

i)  Ne dépassez pas la pression maximale de service de la 
bouteille, même temporairement.
j)  Une fois que les bouteilles sont remplies correctement et 
que le procédé est terminé, vérifiez que les bouteilles et 
l’équipement sont enlevés du site rapidement et que toutes les 
vannes d’isolement sur l’équipement sont fermées.
k)  Le réfrigérant récupéré ne doit pas être chargé dans un autre 
système de réfrigération, à moins qu’il n’ait été nettoyé et inspecté.
10.  Étiquetage
L’équipement doit comporter une étiquette indiquant qu’il a été mis 
hors service et vidé de réfrigérant. L’étiquette doit être datée et signée.
Vérifiez qu’il y a des étiquettes sur l’équipement qui énoncent que 
l’équipement contient un réfrigérant inflammable.
11.  Récupération
En enlevant le réfrigérant d’un système, soit pour l’entretien soit 
pour la mise hors service, il est recommandé et de bonne pratique 
que tous les réfrigérants soient enlevés en toute sécurité. En 
transférant du réfrigérant dans des bouteilles, vérifiez que seules 
des bouteilles de récupération de réfrigérant appropriées sont 
employées. Assurez-vous d’avoir disponible le nombre correct de 
bouteilles pour maintenir la charge totale du système. Toutes les 
bouteilles à utiliser sont conçues pour le réfrigérant récupéré et 
étiquetées pour ce réfrigérant (c’est-à-dire des bouteilles spéciales 
pour la récupération de réfrigérant). Les bouteilles doivent être 
complètes avec un clapet de décharge et des vannes d’isolement 
associées en bon état de marche. Les bouteilles de récupération

vides sont évacuées et, si possible, refroidies avant une opération 
de récupération.
L’équipement de récupération doit être en bon état de 
fonctionnement avec un ensemble d’instructions concernant 
l’équipement qui est à portée de main et doit être adapté à 
la récupération des frigorigènes inflammables. En outre, un 
ensemble de balances étalonnées doit être disponible et en bon 
état de fonctionnement. Les tuyaux doivent être complets avec 
des raccords sans fuite et en bon état. Avant d’utiliser la machine 
de récupération, vérifiez qu’elle est dans un état de marche 
satisfaisant, qu’elle a été correctement entretenue et que tous les 
composants électriques associés sont étanchéifiés afin de prévenir 
l’allumage en cas de libération du réfrigérant. Consultez le fabricant 
en cas de doute. 
Le réfrigérant récupéré doit être retourné au fournisseur de 
réfrigérant dans la bonne bouteille de récupération, et le bordereau 
de transfert des déchets approprié arrangé. Ne mélangez pas des 
réfrigérants dans des unités de récupération et surtout pas dans 
des bouteilles. 
Si des compresseurs ou des huiles de compresseur doivent être 
enlevés, assurez-vous qu’ils ont été évacués à un niveau acceptable 
pour être certain qu’un réfrigérant inflammable ne reste pas dans 
le lubrifiant. Le procédé d’évacuation doit être effectué avant 
de retourner le compresseur aux fournisseurs. Seul le chauffage 
électrique du corps du compresseur doit être utilisé pour accélérer 
ce processus. La vidange d’huile d’un système doit être effectuée en 
toute sécurité.

Informations sur les différents concepts de sécurité:
Non ventilé – (voir ClauseGG.2) La sécurité de l’appareil ne dépend 
pas de la ventilation du boîtier. L’arrêt de l’appareil ou l’ouverture 
du boîtier n’a pas d’effet significatif sur la sécurité. Néanmoins, il 
est possible que des fuites de réfrigérant s’accumulent à l’intérieur 
du boîtier et que l’atmosphère inflammable s’en échappe à son 
ouverture.
Boîtier ventilé – (voir ClauseGG.4) La sécurité de l’appareil dépend 
de la ventilation du boîtier. L’arrêt de l’appareil ou l’ouverture du 
boîtier a un effet significatif sur la sécurité. Des précautions doivent 
être prises pour assurer une ventilation suffisante au préalable.
Local ventilé – (voir ClauseGG.5) La sécurité de l’appareil dépend de 
la ventilation du local. L’arrêt de l’appareil ou l’ouverture du boîtier 
n’a pas d’effet significatif sur la sécurité. La ventilation du local ne 
doit pas être coupée pendant les procédures de réparation.

7.5  Alarme de réservoir d’eau plein
Le réservoir d’eau à l’intérieur du climatiseur dispose d’un indicateur de sécurité qui contrôle le niveau 
d’eau. Lorsque celui-ci atteint une hauteur prévue, le voyant de réservoir d’eau plein s’allume.  
(Si la pompe à eau est endommagée, lorsque le réservoir est plein, retirez le bouchon en caoutchouc 
au-dessous de l’appareil, et toute l’eau sera drainée à l’extérieur.)
A
B
Orifice (A) qui est placé en haut, est à utiliser pour extraire l’eau du climatiseur mobile  
(retirez le bouchon en caoutchouc et ajoutez le tuyau de drainage sur l’orifice) lorsqu’il y a 
beaucoup d’humidité dans la pièce (en drainage continu) ou lorsque le produit fonctionne en mode 
déshumidification ou chauffage.
Orifice (B) qui est placé en bas, dispose d’un réservoir et est à utiliser lorsqu’il est nécessaire de vider 
le réservoir (alarme réservoir d’eau plein). Il suffit de retirer le bouchon en caoutchouc et d’ajouter le 
tuyau de drainage sur l’orifice pour évacuer l’eau du réservoir.
C
Remarque: 
Attention en fonction du remplissage du réservoir d’eau, il y aura parfois beaucoup 
d’eau à évacuer. Alors l’idéal serait d’ouvrir l’orifice et de le vider en extérieur ou de le 
vider au-dessus d’une grande bassine pour éviter d’inonder votre pièce.

Avvertenze (solo per l'utilizzo del refrigerante R290)
1. Istruzioni generali
1.1  Controlli dell'area
Prima di iniziare l'intervento sui sistemi contenenti refrigeranti 
infiammabili, sono necessari controlli di sicurezza per garantire 
di ridurre al minimo il rischio di combustione. Per la riparazione 
del sistema di refrigerazione, attenersi alle precauzioni prima di 
effettuare interventi sul sistema.
1.2  Procedura di lavoro
I lavori devono essere eseguiti in una procedura controllata in modo 
da ridurre al minimo il rischio che un gas infiammabile o vapore sia 
presente durante l'esecuzione del lavoro.
1.3  Area di lavoro generale
Tutto il personale di manutenzione e gli altri che lavorano nell'area 
locale devono essere istruiti sulla natura del lavoro svolto. Il lavoro in 
spazi ristretti deve essere evitato. L'area intorno allo spazio di lavoro 
deve essere sezionata. Assicurarsi che le condizioni all'interno dell'area 
siano state rese sicure dal controllo del materiale infiammabile.
1.4 Controllo della presenza di refrigerante
L'area deve essere controllata con un rilevatore di refrigerante 
adeguato prima e durante il lavoro, per assicurarsi che il tecnico sia 
consapevole della presenza di ambienti potenzialmente infiammabili. 
Assicurarsi che le apparecchiature di rilevamento delle perdite in uso 
siano adatte per l'uso con refrigeranti infiammabili, ovvero senza 
scintille, adeguatamente sigillate o a sicurezza intrinseca.

1.5  Presenza di estintori
Se si deve effettuare un intervento a caldo nelle apparecchiature 
di refrigerazione o in qualsiasi parte associata, tenere a portata di 
mano dispositivi antincendio. Tenere un estintore a polvere asciutta 
o con CO
2
 nei pressi dell'area di carica.
1.6 Nessuna fonte di combustione
Il personale che interviene in un sistema di refrigerazione esponendo 
le tubazioni che contengono o hanno contenuto refrigerante 
infiammabile non deve utilizzare fonti di combustione in modo che 
possa comportare il rischio di incendio o esplosione. Il personale 
non deve essere fumare durante l'intervento. Tutte le possibili 
fonti di combustione, comprese fumare, devono essere tenuti 
sufficientemente lontane dal sito di installazione, riparazione, 
rimozione e smaltimento, durante il quale il refrigerante infiammabile 
può essere rilasciato nello spazio circostante. Prima dell'intervento, 
è necessario controllare l'area intorno alle apparecchiature 
per assicurarsi che non vi siano pericoli infiammabili o rischi di 
combustione. Devono essere apposti cartelli di “Vietato fumare”.
1.7  Area ventilata
Assicurarsi che l'area sia aperta o venga adeguatamente ventilata 
prima di intervenire nel sistema o effettuare qualsiasi intervento 
acaldo. Fornire un grado di ventilazione continua durante il periodo 
dell'intervento. La ventilazione deve disperdere in modo sicuro 
il refrigerante rilasciato e preferibilmente espellerlo all'esterno 
nell'atmosfera.

1.8 Controlli alle apparecchiature di refrigerazione
I componenti elettrici sostituiti devono essere idonei allo scopo 
e alle specifiche corrette. Attenersi sempre alle linee guida di 
manutenzione e assistenza del produttore. In caso di dubbi rivolgersi 
al reparto tecnico del produttore per assistenza. I seguenti controlli 
devono essere applicati agli impianti che utilizzano refrigeranti 
infiammabili: la quantità di carica deve essere conforme alle 
dimensioni della stanza in cui sono installate le parti contenenti 
refrigerante; i meccanismi e le prese di ventilazione devono 
funzionare in modo adeguato e non devono essere ostruiti; se viene 
utilizzato un circuito di refrigerazione indiretta, il circuito secondario 
deve essere controllato per verificare la presenza di refrigerante; i 
contrassegni sull'apparecchiatura devono essere sempre visibili e 
leggibili. I contrassegni e i segni illeggibili devono essere corretti; il 
tubo o i componenti di refrigerazione sono installati in una posizione 
in cui è improbabile che possano essere esposti a qualsiasi sostanza 
che possa corrodere componenti contenenti refrigerante, a meno 
che i componenti non siano realizzati con materiali che sono 
intrinsecamente resistenti alla corrosione o adeguatamente protetti 
da corrosione.

1.9 Controlli ai dispositivi elettrici
La riparazione e la manutenzione di componenti elettrici 
comprendono controlli di sicurezza iniziali e procedure di 
ispezione dei componenti. In presenza di un guasto che potrebbe 
compromettere la sicurezza, l'alimentazione elettrica non deve 
essere collegata al circuito finché il guasto non viene riparato 
in modo soddisfacente. Se il guasto non può essere riparato 
immediatamente, ma è necessario continuare l'operazione, adottare 
un'adeguata soluzione temporanea. Il proprietario del materiale 
deve essere informato o avvisato in modo che possa avvisare tutti.
I controlli di sicurezza iniziali devono comprendere: lo scaricamento 
dei condensatori: questa operazione deve essere eseguita in modo 
sicuro per evitare scintille; non devono esservi componenti elettrici 
sotto tensione e cavi scoperti durante la carica, il recupero o lo 
spurgo del sistema; la messa a terra deve essere continua.
2. Riparazioni ai componenti sigillati
2.1  Durante le riparazioni ai componenti sigillate, scollegare tutta 
l'alimentazione elettrica dalle apparecchiature da sottoporre ad 
intervento prima della rimozione delle coperture sigillate, ecc. Se 
è assolutamente necessario disporre di alimentazione elettrica 
sulle apparecchiature durante la manutenzione, collocare un 
rilevatore di perdite sempre attivo nel punto più critico per 
avvertire di una situazione potenzialmente pericolosa.

2.2 Prestare particolare attenzione a quanto segue per garantire 
che, intervenendo sui componenti elettrici, l'alloggiamento non 
viene alterato in modo tale da influire negativamente sul livello 
di protezione. Ciò include danni ai cavi, un numero eccessivo di 
collegamenti, terminali non conformi alle specifiche originali, 
danni alle guarnizioni, un'installazione non corretta delle 
guarnizioni, ecc. Assicurarsi che gli apparecchi siano montati 
saldamente. Assicurarsi che le guarnizioni o i materiali di tenuta 
non siano degradati in modo da essere inutilizzabili per impedire 
l'ingresso di atmosfere infiammabili. Le parti di ricambio devono 
essere conformi alle specifiche del produttore. 
C
Nota: 
L'uso di sigillante siliconico potrebbe inibire 
l'efficacia di alcuni tipi di apparecchiature di rilevamento 
di perdite. I componenti a sicurezza intrinseca non devono 
essere isolati prima di intervenire su di essi.
3. Riparazione di componenti a sicurezza intrinseca
Non applicare carichi induttivi o capacitivi permanenti al circuito 
senza garantire che non superino la tensione ammissibile e la 
corrente consentita per le apparecchiature in uso.
I componenti a sicurezza intrinseca sono gli unici su cui si può 
intervenire mentre sono sotto tensione in presenza di un'atmosfera 
infiammabile. Le apparecchiature di test devono disporre di una 
portata nominale adeguata. Sostituire i componenti solo con i 
ricambi specificati dal produttore. Le parti non specificate dal 
produttore possono provocare la combustione di refrigerante 
nell'atmosfera a causa di una perdita.

4. Cablaggio
Controllare che il cablaggio non sarà soggetto ad usura, corrosione, 
pressione eccessiva, vibrazioni, bordi taglienti o altri effetti negativi 
sull'ambiente. Il controllo deve inoltre tener conto degli effetti 
dell'invecchiamento o delle vibrazioni continue provenienti da fonti 
quali compressori o ventilatori.
5. Rilevamento di refrigeranti infiammabili
In nessun caso le potenziali fonti di combustione devono essere 
utilizzate per la ricerca o il rilevamento di perdite di refrigerante. Non 
si deve utilizzare una torcia alogena (o qualsiasi altro rivelatore che 
utilizza una fiamma libera).

6. Metodi di rilevamento perdite
I rilevatori elettronici di perdite devono essere utilizzati per 
individuare i refrigeranti infiammabili, ma la sensibilità potrebbe non 
essere adeguata o potrebbe essere necessaria I rilevatori elettronici di 
perdite devono essere utilizzati per rilevare i refrigeranti infiammabili, 
ma la sensibilità potrebbe non essere adeguata oppure potrebbero 
necessitare di una ricalibrazione (leapparecchiature di rilevamento 
devono essere calibrate in un'area priva di refrigerante). Assicurarsi 
che il rivelatore non sia una fonte potenziale di combustione e sia 
adatto per il refrigerante utilizzato. Le apparecchiature di rilevamento 
di perdite devono essere impostate ad una percentuale di LFL 
del refrigerante e calibrato in base al refrigerante impiegato e la 
percentuale appropriata di gas (25%massimo) deve essere verificata. 
I fluidi di rilevamento delle perdite sono adatti per l'uso con la maggior 
parte dei refrigeranti, ma si deve evitare l'uso di detergenti a base di 
cloro in quanto il cloro potrebbe reagire con il refrigerante e corrodere 
le tubazioni di rame. Se si sospetta una fuga, tutte le fiamme libere 
devono essere rimosse/spente. In caso di perdita di refrigerante che 
richiede brasatura, tutto il refrigerante viene recuperato dal sistema o 
isolato (tramite valvole di isolamento) in una parte del sistema lontana 
dalla perdita. L'azoto esente da ossigeno (OFN) viene quindi spurgato 
attraverso il sistema sia prima che durante il processo di brasatura.

7. Rimozione ed evacuazione
Quando si interviene sul circuito refrigerante per effettuare 
le riparazioni o per qualsiasi altro scopo, utilizzare procedure 
convenzionali. Tuttavia, è importante osservare le migliori prassi 
tenendo in considerazione l'infiammabilità. Attenersi alla seguente 
procedura: rimuovere il refrigerante; spurgare il circuito con gas 
inerte; svuotare; spurgare di nuovo con gas inerte; interrompere il 
circuito tramite intercettazione o brasatura. La carica di refrigerante 
deve essere recuperata nelle bombole di recupero appropriate. 
Eseguire il “flussaggio” del sistema con OFN per rendere sicura 
l'unità. Potrebbe essere necessario ripetere più volte questa 
procedura. Non utilizzare aria compressa o ossigeno per questa 
operazione. Il flussaggio si ottiene interrompendo il vuoto nel 
sistema con OFN e continuando a riempire fino al raggiungimento 
della pressione di esercizio, quindi sfiatando nell'atmosfera e infine 
tirando verso il vuoto. Questo processo deve essere ripetuto finché 
non vi è più refrigerante all'interno del sistema. Quando si utilizza la 
carica OFN finale, il sistema deve essere sfiatato fino alla pressione 
atmosferica per consentire l'intervento. Questa operazione è 
assolutamente vitale se si devono effettuare le operazioni di 
brasatura sulle tubazioni.
Assicurarsi che la presa della pompa a vuoto non sia vicino a fonti di 
combustione e che sia disponibile ventilazione.

8. Procedure di carica
Oltre alle procedure di carica convenzionali, attenersi ai seguenti requisiti:
 -
Assicurarsi che non si verifichi la contaminazione di diversi 
refrigeranti quando si utilizzano apparecchiature di carica. 
Iflessibili o i condotti devono essere più corti possibili per ridurre 
al minimo la quantità di refrigerante contenuta.
 -
Le bombole devono essere tenute in posizione verticale.
 -
Assicurarsi che il sistema refrigerante sia collegato a terra prima 
di caricare il sistema con refrigerante.
 -
Etichettare il sistema al termine della carica (se non è già etichettato).
 -
Prestare estrema cautela a non riempire eccessivamente il 
sistema refrigerante.
Prima di caricare il sistema, è necessario testare la con pressione con 
OFN. Devono essere testate eventuali perdite del sistema al termine 
di ricarica, ma prima della messa in servizio. Prima di uscire dal sito, è 
necessario effettuare un ulteriore test di perdite.
9. Messa fuori servizio
Prima di effettuare questa procedura, è essenziale che il tecnico 
abbia acquisito piena familiarità con le apparecchiature e tutti i suoi 
dettagli. Si raccomanda di adottare una buona prassi per recuperare 
in modo sicuro tutti i refrigeranti. Prima di effettuare l'operazione, 
nel caso in cui sia necessaria l'analisi del refrigerante recuperato 
prima del riutilizzo, prelevare un campione di olio e refrigerante. 
È essenziale che l'alimentazione elettrica sia disponibile prima di 
iniziare operazione.

133 / 396 IT
a) Acquisire familiarità con le apparecchiature e il relativo 
funzionamento.
b) Isolare elettricamente il sistema.
c)  Prima di eseguire la procedura, verificare quanto segue: 
le apparecchiature meccaniche di movimentazione sono 
disponibili, ove necessario, per la movimentazione di bombole 
di refrigerante; tutte le attrezzature di protezione individuale 
sono disponibili e devono essere utilizzate in modo corretto; 
il processo di recupero è monitorato in ogni momento da 
personale competente; le apparecchiature di recupero e le 
bombole devono essere conformi agli standard adeguati.
d) Ove possibile, pompare il sistema di refrigerante.
e) Se il vuoto non è possibile, fare in modo che un collettore 
rimuova il refrigerante da varie parti del sistema.
f)  Assicurarsi che la bombola si trovi sulle bilance prima di 
effettuare il recupero.
g) Avviare la macchina di recupero e azionarla in conformità alle 
istruzioni del produttore.
h) Non riempire eccessivamente le bombole. (Non oltre l'80% del 
volume di carica del liquido).
i)  Non superare la pressione massima di esercizio delle bombole, 
seppure temporaneamente.

134 / 396 IT
Condizionatore d’aria mobile / Manuale dell’utente
j)  Una volta riempite correttamente le bombole e terminato il 
processo, assicurarsi che le bombole e le apparecchiature siano 
state rimosse tempestivamente dal sito e tutte le valvole di 
isolamento sulle apparecchiature siano chiuse.
k)  Il refrigerante recuperato non deve essere caricato in un altro 
sistema di refrigerazione a meno che non sia stato pulito e 
controllato.
10.  Etichettatura
Le apparecchiature devono essere etichettate indicando la messa 
fuori servizio e lo svuotamento di refrigerante. L'etichetta deve 
essere datata e firmata.
Assicurarsi che sulle apparecchiature siano presenti delle etichette 
che indichino la presenza di refrigerante infiammabile.
11.  Recupero
Quando si rimuove il refrigerante da un sistema, per la manutenzione 
o la messa fuori servizio, si raccomanda di adottare una buona prassi 
per rimuovere in modo sicuro tutti i refrigeranti. Quando si trasferisce 
il refrigerante in bombole, assicurarsi di utilizzare esclusivamente 
bombole adeguate per il recupero del refrigerante. Assicurarsi che 
sia disponibile il numero corretto di bombole per la carica totale 
del sistema. Tutte le bombole da utilizzare sono designate per il 
refrigerante recuperato ed etichettate per tale refrigerante (ovvero 
bombole speciali per il recupero del refrigerante). Le bombole devono 
essere dotate di valvola di sicurezza e relative valvole di isolamento 
in buone condizioni. Le bombole di recupero sono evacuate e, ove 
possibile, raffreddate prima del recupero.
1  Informazioni sulla sicurezza

--- Page 135 ---
Condizionatore d’aria mobile / Manuale dell’utente
135 / 396 IT
Le apparecchiature di recupero devono essere in buone condizioni 
con una serie di istruzioni relative alle apparecchiature a portata 
di mano e devono essere adeguate per il recupero dei refrigeranti 
infiammabili. Inoltre, una serie di bilance calibrate deve essere 
disponibile e in buone condizioni. I flessibili devono essere dotati di 
attacchi di scollegamento privi di perdite e in buone condizioni. Prima 
di utilizzare la macchina di recupero, verificare che sia in condizioni 
di funzionamento soddisfacente, sia stata effettuata una corretta 
manutenzione e tutti i componenti elettrici associati siano sigillati 
per evitare la combustione in caso di rilascio di refrigerante. In caso 
di dubbi, consultare il produttore. 
Il refrigerante recuperato deve essere riportato al fornitore del 
refrigerante nella bombola di recupero adeguata e con la relativa 
Nota di trasferimento dei rifiuti compilata. Non mischiare i 
refrigeranti in unità di recupero e, soprattutto, non in bombole. 
Se si devono rimuovere compressori o olio per compressori, 
assicurarsi che siano stati evacuati ad un livello accettabile per 
garantire che il refrigerante infiammabile non rimanga all'interno del 
lubrificante. Il processo di evacuazione deve essere effettuato prima 
di riportare il compressore ai fornitori. Adottare esclusivamente il 
riscaldamento elettrico sul corpo del compressore per accelerare 
questo processo. Quando si scarica l'olio da un sistema, l'operazione 
deve essere eseguita in modo sicuro.

termosifoni elettrici.
Informazioni sui diversi concetti di sicurezza:
Scarsa ventilazione (vedi Clausola GG.2) La sicurezza dell'apparecchio 
non dipende dalla ventilazione dell’alloggiamento. Lo spegnimento 
dell'apparecchio o l’apertura dell'alloggiamento non produce effettivi 
significativi sulla sicurezza. Tuttavia, è possibile che a seguito di 
perdite possa accumularsi del refrigerante all’interno dell'involucro, 
rilasciando un'atmosfera infiammabile all'apertura dello stesso.
Ventilazione dell’involucro (vedi Clausola GG.4) La sicurezza 
dell'apparecchio dipende dalla ventilazione dell’alloggiamento. Lo 
spegnimento dell'apparecchio o l’apertura dell'involucro produce 
effettivi significativi sulla sicurezza. Occorre garantire una 
ventilazione sufficiente.
Ventilazione dell’ambiente (vedi Clausola GG.4) La sicurezza 
dell'apparecchio dipende dalla ventilazione dell’ambiente. 
Lospegnimento dell'apparecchio o l’apertura dell'alloggiamento

Waarschuwingen (alleen bij het gebruik van R290 koelmiddel)
1. Algemene instructies
1.1  Controles voor de ruimte
Voordat u met systemen met ontvlambare koelmiddelen aan de slag 
gaat, moeten er een aantal veiligheidscontroles worden uitgevoerd 
om ervoor te zorgen dat het risico op ontsteking geminimaliseerd 
wordt. Voor reparaties aan het koelsysteem moeten de volgende 
voorzorgsmaatregelen in acht worden genomen voordat er aan het 
systeem wordt gewerkt.
1.2  Werkprocedure
De werkzaamheden moeten worden uitgevoerd volgens een 
gecontroleerde procedure om het risico op ontsteking van 
ontvlambaar gas of ontvlambare damp te minimaliseren.
1.3  Algemeen werkgebied
Al het onderhoudspersoneel en anderen die in de directe omgeving 
werken, moeten worden geïnstrueerd over de aard van de 
uitgevoerde werkzaamheden. Werk in besloten ruimtes moet 
worden vermeden. De ruimte rondom de werkplek moet worden 
afgezet. Zorg ervoor dat de omstandigheden binnen de ruimte veilig 
zijn gesteld door controle op brandbare materialen.
1.4 Controle op aanwezigheid van koelmiddel
De ruimte moet worden gecontroleerd met een geschikte 
koelmiddeldetector vóór en tijdens de werkzaamheden om te 
garanderen dat de technicus zich bewust is van een mogelijk 
brandbare atmosfeer. Zorg dat de lekdetectieapparatuur die wordt 
gebruikt gepast is voor gebruik met ontvlambare koelmiddelen, 
d.w.z. vonkvrij, goed verzegeld of intrinsiek veilig.
1  Veiligheidsmaatregelen

--- Page 181 ---
Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
181 / 396 NL
1.5  Aanwezigheid van brandblussers
Als er enige hete werkzaamheden op de koelapparatuur of enige 
bijbehorende onderdelen moeten worden uitgevoerd, moet er 
geschikte brandblusapparatuur binnen handbereik beschikbaar zijn. 
Zorg voor een poeder- of CO
2
-brandblusser naast het vulgebied.
1.6 Geen ontstekingsbronnen
Niemand die werk uitvoert aan het koelsysteem dat betrekking heeft 
tot het leidingsysteem dat ontvlambaar koelmiddel bevat of heeft 
bevat mag ontstekingsbronnen gebruiken omdat hierdoor kans 
op brand of explosie ontstaat. Alle mogelijke ontstekingsbronnen, 
waaronder sigaretten roken, moeten op gepaste afstand van de 
installatie-, reparatie-, verwijderings- en afvoerlocatie worden 
gehouden op momenten dat ontvlambaar koelmiddel mogelijk kan 
vrijkomen in de omgeving. De ruimte rondom de apparatuur moet 
voorafgaand aan het uitvoeren van de werkzaamheden worden 
geïnspecteerd om te verzekeren dat er zich geen brandgevaar of 
risico op ontsteking voordoet. Er moeten borden met “Niet roken” 
worden weergegeven.
1.7  Geventileerd gebied
Zorg ervoor dat de ruimte open is of dat deze voldoende is geventileerd 
voordat u inbreekt in het systeem of enige hete werkzaamheden 
uitvoert. Er moet een bepaalde mate van ventilatie in stand blijven, 
tijdens de periode dat de werkzaamheden worden uitgevoerd. 
De ventilatie moet enige vrijkomend koelmiddel op veilige wijze 
verspreiden en het bij voorkeur extern in de atmosfeer uitstoten.

1.8 Controles van de koelapparatuur
Wanneer elektrische componenten worden vervangen, moeten deze 
geschikt zijn voor het doel en aan de juiste specificaties voldoen. De 
richtlijnen voor onderhoud en reparaties van de fabrikant moeten 
te allen tijde worden opgevolgd. Raadpleeg bij twijfel de technische 
afdeling van de fabrikant voor hulp. De volgende controles moeten 
worden uitgevoerd bij installaties met ontvlambare koelmiddelen: 
de ladinggrootte is in overeenstemming met de grootte van de 
kamer waarin de onderdelen met koelmiddelen worden geplaatst, 
de ventilatieapparatuur en -uitgangen werken goed en worden niet 
geblokkeerd, als er een indirect koelcircuit wordt gebruikt, moet 
het secundaire circuit worden gecontroleerd op aanwezigheid 
van koelmiddel, markering van de apparatuur moet zichtbaar en 
leesbaar blijven. Markeringen en tekens die onleesbaar zijn moeten 
worden gecorrigeerd, koelingsbuizen of -onderdelen moeten 
worden geplaatst in een positie waarbij ze niet worden blootgesteld 
aan substanties die onderdelen met koelmiddel kunnen aantasten, 
tenzij de onderdelen uit materialen bestaan die bestendig zijn tegen 
aantasting of die beschermd zijn tegen aantasting.

1.9 Controles van elektrische apparaten
Reparaties en onderhoud aan elektrische componenten moeten 
procedures voor initiële veiligheidscontroles en inspectie van 
componenten inhouden. Als er zich een storing voordoet die 
de veiligheid in gevaar zou kunnen brengen, dan mag er geen 
elektrische stroomvoorziening op het circuit worden aangesloten 
totdat de storing bevredigend is verholpen. Als de storing niet 
onmiddellijk kan worden gecorrigeerd, maar het noodzakelijk is om 
het bedrijf voort te zetten, moet er een geschikte tijdelijke oplossing 
worden toegepast. Dit moet aan de eigenaar van de apparatuur 
worden gerapporteerd, zodat alle partijen worden geïnformeerd.
Initiële veiligheidscontroles zijn: de condensators zijn ontladen, dit 
moet op een veilige manier worden gedaan om de kans op vonken 
te voorkomen; er mogen geen elektrische onderdelen en kabels zijn 
blootgesteld tijdens het vullen, terugwinnen of reinigen van het 
systeem; er moet ononderbroken aardingsverbinding zijn.
2. Reparaties van verzegelde onderdelen
2.1  Tijdens reparaties van verzegelde onderdelen moeten alle 
elektrische onderdelen losgekoppeld zijn van het apparaat 
waaraan gewerkt wordt voordat de verzegelde ventielen, etc. 
verwijderd worden. Als het absoluut nodig is om elektriciteit 
te hebben tijdens het onderhoud, moet er een permanent 
werkende vorm van lekdetectie worden geplaatst op het meest 
kritieke punt voor het geval van een mogelijk gevaarlijke situatie.

2.2 Er moet met name aandacht worden besteed aan het volgende 
om te zorgen dat de behuizing tijdens de werkzaamheden aan 
de elektrische onderdelen niet zodanig wordt aangepast dat 
het beschermingsniveau wordt beïnvloed. Dit omvat schade aan 
kabels, een overmatig aantal verbindingen, terminals die niet 
volgens de oorspronkelijke specificaties zijn gemaakt, schade 
aan de verzegelingen, onjuiste plaatsing van afdichtingen, 
enz. Zorg dat het apparaat goed bevestigd is. Zorg dat de 
verzegelingen of het afdichtingsmateriaal niet zodanig 
aangetast is dat het niet meer in staat is om bescherming te 
bieden tegen de binnendringing van ontvlambare atmosferen. 
Vervangende onderdelen moeten voldoen aan de specificaties 
van de fabrikant. 
C
Opmerking: 
Het gebruik van een silicone 
afdichting kan de effectiviteit van sommige soorten 
lekdetectieapparatuur belemmeren. Intrinsiek veilige 
onderdelen hoeven niet geïsoleerd te worden voordat u 
ermee aan de slag gaat.

Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
185 / 396 NL
3. Reparaties van de intrinsiek veilige onderdelen.
Pas geen permanente inductieve of capacitieve ladingen toe op 
het circuit zonder te controleren of deze de toegestane voltage en 
spanning voor het apparaat niet overschrijden.
Intrinsiek veilige onderdelen zijn de enige types waaraan gewerkt 
kan worden in een ontvlambare atmosfeer. Het testapparaat 
moet de correcte rating hebben. Vervang onderdelen alleen door 
onderdelen die zijn gespecificeerd door de fabrikant. Andere 
onderdelen kunnen leiden tot ontsteking van het koelmiddel in de 
atmosfeer door een lek.
4. Bekabeling
Controleer of de kabel niet onderhevig is aan slijtage, aantasting, 
overmatige druk, vibraties, scherpe randen en andere nadelige 
omgevingseffecten. Tijdens de controle moet u ook kijken of de kabel 
niet versleten is en dat er geen ononderbroken vibraties afkomstig 
van bronnen zoals compressors of ventilatoren aanwezig zijn.
5. Detectie van ontvlambare koelmiddelen
Er mogen onder geen enkele omstandigheden mogelijke 
ontstekingsbronnen worden gebruikt tijdens het zoeken naar of 
de detectie van koelmiddellekken. Een halogenide zaklamp (of een 
andere detector met een naakte vlam) mag niet worden gebruikt.

186 / 396 NL
Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
6. Methodes voor lekdetectie
De volgende methodes voor lekdetectie zijn acceptabel voor 
systemen met ontvlambare koelmiddelen. Elektronische 
lekdetectors kunnen worden gebruikt om ontvlambare koelmiddelen 
te detecteren, maar de gevoeligheid is mogelijk niet nauwkeurig 
of moet gekalibreerd worden. (Detectieapparatuur moet worden 
gekalibreerd in een koelmiddelvrije ruimte.) Zorg dat de detector 
geen mogelijke ontstekingsbron is en geschikt is voor het 
koelmiddel dat wordt gebruikt. Lekdetectieapparatuur moet worden 
ingesteld op een percentage van de LFL van het koelmiddel en moet 
worden gekalibreerd voor het koelmiddel dat wordt gebruikt en 
wanneer het gepaste gaspercentage (25% maximaal) is bevestigd. 
Lekdetectievloeistoffen zijn geschikt voor gebruik met de meeste 
koelmiddelen, maar het gebruik van schoonmaakmiddelen moet 
worden vermeden omdat chloor kan reageren op het koelmiddel 
en de koperen buizen kan aantasten. Als u denkt dat er een lek 
is, moeten alle vlammen worden verwijderd/gedoofd. Als er een 
koelmiddellek wordt gevonden dat gesoldeerd moet worden, 
moet al het koelmiddel uit het systeem worden gehaald of worden 
geïsoleerd (door de ventielen te sluiten) in een deel van het 
systeem, uit de buurt van het lek. Zuurstofvrije stikstof (OFN) moet 
worden gezuiverd door het systeem, zowel vóór als tijdens het 
soldeerproces.

7. Verwijdering en leeg laten lopen
Wanneer u het koelcircuit opent voor reparaties, of voor andere 
doeleinden, moeten er conventionele procedures worden gebruikt. 
Het is echter belangrijk dat de best practice wordt gevolgd omdat 
brandbaarheid in overweging moet worden genomen. De volgende 
procedure moet gevolgd worden: verwijder het koelmiddel, reinig 
het circuit met inert gas, laat het leeglopen, reinig nogmaals 
met inert gas, open het circuit door te snijden of te solderen. De 
koelmiddelvulling moet in de juiste terugwincilinders worden 
gedaan. Het systeem moet worden 'gespoeld’ met OFN zodat het 
apparaat weer als veilig kan worden beschouwd. Dit proces moet 
mogelijk een aantal keer herhaald worden. Er mag geen perslucht 
of zuurstof worden gebruikt voor deze taak. Het spoelen doet 
u door het vacuüm in het systeem met OFN te breken en het te 
blijven vullen tot de werkdruk is bereikt, daarna moet de atmosfeer 
worden geventileerd en ten slotte moet het in een vacuüm worden 
getrokken. Dit proces moet worden herhaald tot er geen koelmiddel 
meer in het systeem zit. Wanneer de laatste OFN-vulling is gebruikt, 
moet het systeem worden geventileerd tot atmosferische druk 
zodat de werkzaamheden kunnen worden uitgevoerd. Deze 
handeling is essentieel als er aan de buizen wordt gesoldeerd.
Zorg dat de uitgang van de vacuümpomp niet te dicht bij een 
ontstekingsbron is en dat er ventilatie beschikbaar is.
8. Vulprocedures
Naast de normale vulprocedures, moeten de volgende vereisten 
worden gevolgd.
1  Veiligheidsmaatregelen

--- Page 188 ---
188 / 396 NL
Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
 -
Zorg dat er geen verontreiniging optreedt door verschillende 
koelmiddelen bij het gebruik van vulapparatuur. Slangen of 
leidingen moeten zo kort mogelijk worden gehouden om 
de hoeveelheid koelmiddel in de slangen of leidingen te 
minimaliseren.
 -
Cilinders moeten rechtop worden gehouden.
 -
Zorg dat het koelsysteem geaard is vóór u het systeem vult met 
koelmiddel.
 -
Markeer het systeem wanneer het vullen is voltooid (als dat niet 
al is gebeurd).
 -
Let goed op dat u het koelsysteem niet te vol vult.
Voor u het systeem opnieuw vult, moet de druk worden beproefd 
met OFN. Het systeem moet op lekkage worden getest na voltooiing 
van het vullen maar vóór inbedrijfstelling. Er moet een tweede 
lektest worden uitgevoerd voordat u de locatie verlaat.
9. Buitengebruikstelling
Voor u deze procedure uitvoert, is het essentieel dat de monteur 
volledig bekend is met de apparatuur en alle details. Het wordt 
als een goede praktijk gezien dat al het koelmiddel veilig wordt 
teruggewonnen. Voordat deze taak wordt uitgevoerd, moet er 
een olie- en koelmiddelmonster worden afgenomen voor het geval 
een analyse vereist is voor het hergebruik van teruggewonnen 
koelmiddel. Het is essentieel dat er stroom beschikbaar is vóór de 
taak wordt gestart. 
1  Veiligheidsmaatregelen

--- Page 189 ---
Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
189 / 396 NL
a) Leer de apparatuur en de bediening kennen.
b) Isoleer het systeem elektrisch.
c)  Zorg er óór u de procedure start voor dat: er mechanisch 
afhandelingsmaterieel beschikbaar is, indien nodig, voor 
het behandelen van de koelcilinders; alle persoonlijke 
beschermingsapparatuur beschikbaar is en correct wordt 
gebruikt; het terugwinproces te allen tijde wordt overzien 
door een competent persoon; de terugwinningsapparatuur en 
-cilinders voldoen aan de gepaste normen.
d) Pomp het koelsysteem leeg, indien mogelijk.
e) Als een vacuüm niet mogelijk is, maak dan een spruitstuk zodat 
het koelmiddel uit verschillende onderdelen van het systeem 
kan worden verwijderd.
f)  Zorg dat de cilinder op de schalen staat vóór de terugwinning 
plaatsvindt.
g) Start de terugwinningsmachine en bedien deze in 
overeenstemming met de instructies van de fabrikant.
h) Vul de cilinders niet te vol. (Niet meer dan 80% vloeibare 
inhoud).
i)  Overschrijd de maximale werkdruk van de cilinder niet, ook niet 
tijdelijk.
j)  Wanneer de cilinders correct gevuld zijn en het proces voltooid 
is, verwijder de cilinders en de apparatuur dan snel en zorg dat 
alle isolatieventielen op het apparaat zijn gesloten.
k)  Teruggewonnen koelmiddel mag niet in een ander koelsysteem 
worden gevuld, tenzij het is gereinigd en gecontroleerd.
1  Veiligheidsmaatregelen

--- Page 190 ---
190 / 396 NL
Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
10.  Markeren
De apparatuur moet worden gemarkeerd als buiten gebruik 
gesteld en geleegd van koelmiddel. Het label moet gedagtekend en 
getekend zijn.
Zorg dat alle labels op het apparaat vermelden dat het apparaat 
ontvlambaar koelmiddel bevat.
11.  Herstel
Wanneer u koelmiddel uit een systeem verwijdert, voor onderhoud 
of buitengebruikstelling, wordt het aanbevolen dat al het koelmiddel 
veilig wordt verwijderd. Wanneer u koelmiddel in cilinders plaatst, 
zorg dan dat alleen geschikte cilinders voor koelstofterugwinning 
worden gebruikt. Zorg dat het juiste aantal cilinders beschikbaar 
is voor de totale vulling van het systeem. Alle cilinders die worden 
gebruikt zijn bestemd voor het teruggewonnen koelmiddel en 
gemarkeerd voor dat koelmiddel (d.w.z. speciale cilinders voor de 
terugwinning van koelmiddel). Cilinders moeten een overdrukventiel 
en bijbehorende afsluitklep hebben voor een goede werking. Lege 
terugwinningscilinders moeten worden geëvacueerd en, indien 
mogelijk, afgekoeld voordat terugwinning plaatsvindt.
1  Veiligheidsmaatregelen

--- Page 191 ---
Plaatselijke air conditioner / Gebruikershandleiding 
191 / 396 NL
De terugwinningsapparatuur moet goed werken en instructies 
bevatten en het moet geschikt zijn voor de terugwinning van 
ontvlambare koelmiddelen. Daarnaast moet er een set gekalibreerde, 
goed werkende weegschalen beschikbaar zijn. Slangen moeten een 
lekvrije loskoppelingen hebben en in goede staat zijn. Voordat u de 
terugwinningsmachine gebruikt, controleert u of deze goed werkt, 
goed onderhouden is en dat bijbehorende elektrische onderdelen 
verzegeld zijn om ontsteking te voorkomen in het geval dat er 
koelmiddel vrijkomt. Raadpleeg bij twijfel de fabrikant. 
Het teruggewonnen koelmiddel moet worden teruggebracht 
naar de leverancier in de juiste terugwinningscilinder en er moet 
een relevant afvaloverdrachtsnotitie aanwezig zijn. Meng geen 
koelmiddelen in terugwinningseenheden, vooral niet in cilinders. 
Als compressors of compressoroliën verwijderd moeten worden, 
zorg dan dat ze geëvacueerd zijn naar een acceptabel niveau om er 
zeker van te zijn dat er geen ontvlambaar koelmiddel meer in het 
smeermiddel zit. Het leegloopproces moet worden uitgevoerd vóór 
u de compressor naar de leveranciers retourneert. Alleen elektrische 
verwarming mag worden toegepast bij de compressorbehuizing 
om dit proces te versnellen. Wanneer olie uit het systeem wordt 
gelaten, moet dit veilig gebeuren.

Competentie van onderhoudspersoneel
Algemeen
Er is speciale training vereist in aanvulling op de gebruikelijke 
reparatieprocedures voor koelapparatuur als apparatuur met 
brandbare koelmiddelen wordt beïnvloed.
In veel landen wordt deze training verzorgd door nationale 
opleidingsinstituten die officieel zijn erkend om de relevante 
nationale normen voor vakbekwaamheid te onderwijzen, die in 
wetgeving kan zijn vastgelegd.
De bereikte vakbekwaamheid moet door een certificaat worden 
gedocumenteerd.
1  Veiligheidsmaatregelen

Training
De training moet het volgende bevatten:
Informatie over de kans op explosie van ontvlambare koelmiddelen 
om aan te tonen dat ontvlambare stoffen gevaarlijk kunnen zijn als 
er niet voorzichtig mee omgegaan wordt.
Informatie over mogelijke ontstekingsbronnen, vooral de bronnen 
die niet vanzelfsprekend zijn, zoals aanstekers, lichtschakelaars, 
stofzuigers en elektrische verwarmingen.
Informatie over de verschillende veiligheidsconcepten:
Ongeventileerd – (zie clausule GG.2) Veiligheid van het apparaat 
is niet afhankelijk van de ventilatie van de behuizing. Als u het 
apparaat uitschakelt of de behuizing opent heeft dit geen effect 
op de veiligheid. Het is hoe dan ook mogelijk dat lekkend koelmiddel 
zich kan ophopen in de behuizing en dat ontvlambare atmosfeer kan 
vrijkomen wanneer de behuizing wordt geopend.
Geventileerde behuizing – (zie clausule GG.4) Veiligheid van het 
apparaat is afhankelijk van de ventilatie van de behuizing. Als u het 
apparaat uitschakelt of de behuizing opent heeft dit effect op de 
veiligheid. Zorg dat er voldoende ventilatie is voor u dit doet.
Geventileerde ruimte – (zie clausule GG.5) Veiligheid van het 
apparaat is afhankelijk van de ventilatie van de ruimte. Als u het 
apparaat uitschakelt of de behuizing opent heeft dit geen effect 
op de veiligheid. De ventilatie van de ruimte mag niet worden 
uitgeschakeld tijdens de reparatieprocedures.
Informatie over het concept van verzegelde onderdelen en 
verzegelde behuizingen volgens IEC 60079-15:2010.

Warnungen (nur für Kältemittel R290)
1. Allgemeine Anweisungen
1.1  Überprüfung der Umgebung
Vor Beginn der Arbeiten an Systemen, die brennbare Kältemittel 
enthalten, sind Sicherheitsüberprüfungen erforderlich, um 
sicherzustellen, dass die Zündgefahr minimiert wird. Für 
Reparaturen am Kühlsystem sind vor Durchführung von Arbeiten 
am System die folgenden Vorsichtsmaßnahmen zu beachten.
1.2  Arbeitsverfahren
Die Arbeiten sind nach einem überwachten Verfahren 
durchzuführen, um das Risiko des Vorhandenseins eines 
entflammbaren Gases oder Dampfes während der Durchführung der 
Arbeiten zu minimieren.
1.3  Allgemeiner Arbeitsbereich
Alle Wartungskräfte und andere in der Umgebung tätige Personen 
müssen über die Art der durchgeführten Arbeiten unterrichtet 
werden. Arbeiten in beengten Räumen sind zu vermeiden. Die 
Umgebung um den Arbeitsbereich herum muss abgetrennt werden. 
Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Umgebungsbedingungen sicher sind.  
Es darf sich kein brennbares Material in der Nähe befinden.
1.4 Prüfen, ob Kältemittel vorhanden ist
Der Bereich muss vor und während der Arbeit mit einem geeigneten 
Kältemitteldetektor überprüft werden, um sicherzustellen, dass sich 
der Techniker möglicherweise brennbarer Atmosphären bewusst 
ist. Stellen Sie sicher, dass das verwendete Leckerkennungsgerät 
für brennbare Kältemittel geeignet ist, d. h., dass es funkenfrei, 
ausreichend dicht oder eigensicher ist.
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 238 ---
238 / 396 DE
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
1.5  Vorhandensein eines Feuerlöschers
Wenn Heißarbeit an der Kühlanlage oder zugehörigen Teilen 
durchgeführt werden sollen, müssen geeignete Feuerlöschgeräte 
zur Verfügung stehen. Halten Sie einen Trockenpulver- oder  
CO
2
-Löscher in der Nähe des Ladebereichs bereit.
1.6 Keine Zündquellen
Personen, die Arbeiten in Bezug auf ein Kühlsystem durchführen, bei 
denen Rohrleitungen mit brennbarem Kältemittel freigelegt werden 
oder brennbares Kältemittel darin enthalten ist, dürfen Zündquellen 
nicht so einsetzen, dass eine Brand- oder Explosionsgefahr besteht. 
Alle möglichen Zündquellen, einschließlich des Rauchens von 
Zigaretten, sollten ausreichend weit vom Installations-, Reparatur-, 
Demontage- und Entsorgungsort entfernt gehalten werden, wobei 
möglicherweise entzündbares Kältemittel in die unmittelbare 
Umgebung abgegeben werden kann. Vor Beginn der Arbeiten ist der 
Bereich um das Gerät herum zu untersuchen, um sicherzustellen, 
dass keine entflammbaren Gefahren oder Zündgefahren bestehen. 
Schilder mit der Aufschrift „Rauchen verboten“ müssen angebracht 
werden.
1.7  Belüfteter Bereich
Stellen Sie sicher, dass sich der Bereich im Freien befindet oder 
ausreichend belüftet ist, bevor Sie in das System eingreifen 
oder Heißarbeit ausführen. Während des Zeitraums, in dem die 
Arbeiten ausgeführt werden, muss ein gewisser Belüftungsgrad 
gewährleistet werden. Die Belüftung sollte das freigesetzte 
Kältemittel sicher verteilen und vorzugsweise nach außen in die 
Atmosphäre ausstoßen.
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 239 ---
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
239 / 396 DE
1.8 Überprüfung der Klimaanlage
Wenn elektrische Komponenten ausgetauscht werden, müssen 
sie für den Zweck geeignet sein und die korrekte Spezifikation 
aufweisen. Die Wartungs- und Servicerichtlinien des Herstellers 
sind immer zu befolgen. Wenden Sie sich im Zweifelsfall für 
Unterstützung an die technische Abteilung des Herstellers.Bei 
Anlagen, die mit brennbaren Kältemitteln arbeiten, sind folgende 
Überprüfungen durchzuführen: Die Größe der Füllung entspricht der 
Raumgröße, in der die kältemittelhaltigen Teile installiert sind; die 
Lüftungsmaschinen und Auslässe arbeiten angemessen und werden 
nicht verstopft; wenn ein indirekter Kältekreislauf verwendet wird, 
ist der Sekundärkreislauf auf das Vorhandensein von Kältemittel 
zu überprüfen; die Kennzeichnung der Geräte ist weiterhin 
sichtbar und lesbar. Unleserliche Markierungen und Schilder sind 
zu korrigieren; Kühlrohre oder -komponenten sind an einer Stelle 
installiert, an denen es unwahrscheinlich ist, dass sie irgendwelchen 
Stoffen ausgesetzt sind, die kältemittelhaltige Komponenten 
korrodieren könnten. Ausgenommen sind Komponenten, die aus 
Materialien bestehen, die von Natur aus korrosionsbeständig sind 
oder die gegen eine solche Korrosion angemessen geschützt sind.
1.9 Überprüfung elektrischer Geräte
Reparaturen und Wartungsarbeiten an elektrischen Komponenten 
müssen erste Sicherheitsüberprüfungen und Bauteilprüfverfahren 
umfassen. Wenn ein Fehler vorliegt, der die Sicherheit 
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 240 ---
240 / 396 DE
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
beeinträchtigen könnte, darf an den Stromkreis keine elektrische 
Versorgung angeschlossen werden, bis der Fehler zufriedenstellend 
behoben ist. Wenn der Fehler nicht sofort behoben werden kann, 
der Betrieb jedoch fortgesetzt werden muss, ist eine angemessene 
vorübergehende Lösung zu verwenden. Dies ist dem Besitzer der 
Anlage mitzuteilen, damit alle Parteien davon unterrichtet werden.
Zu den ersten Sicherheitsprüfungen gehören: dass die 
Kondensatoren entladen werden: dies muss auf sichere Art und 
Weise geschehen, um die Möglichkeit einer Funkenbildung zu 
vermeiden; dass keine stromführenden elektrischen Komponenten 
und Leitungen während des Ladens, Wiederherstellens oder 
Spülens des Systems freigelegt werden; dass eine kontinuierliche 
Erdung vorhanden ist.
2. Reparaturen an versiegelten Komponenten
2.1  Bei Reparaturen an versiegelten Komponenten müssen alle 
elektrischen Versorgungen von dem zu bearbeitenden Gerät 
getrennt werden, bevor Sie versiegelte Abdeckungen usw. 
entfernen. Wenn während des Wartungsvorgangs unbedingt 
eine Stromversorgung für das Gerät erforderlich ist, muss sich 
eine dauerhaft funktionierende Form der Leckerkennung an 
der kritischsten Stelle befinden, um vor einer möglicherweise 
gefährlichen Situation zu warnen.
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 241 ---
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
241 / 396 DE
2.2 Folgendes ist besonders zu beachten, um sicherzustellen, dass 
bei Arbeiten an elektrischen Komponenten das Gehäuse nicht 
so verändert wird, dass das Schutzniveau beeinträchtigt wird. 
Dazu gehören Kabelschäden, zu viele Anschlüsse, nicht gemäß 
den Originalspezifikationen angefertigte Klemmen, Dichtungen, 
falsche Verschraubungen usw. Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Gerät 
sicher befestigt ist. Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Dichtungen 
oder Dichtungsmaterialien nicht so gealtert oder beschädigt 
sind, dass sie nicht mehr dafür sorgen, das Eindringen von 
brennbaren Atmosphären zu verhindern. Ersatzteile müssen den 
Spezifikationen des Herstellers entsprechen. 
C
Hinweis: 
Die Verwendung von Silikondichtungsmittel 
kann die Wirksamkeit einiger Arten von 
Leckerkennungsgeräten beeinträchtigen. Eigensichere 
Komponenten müssen vor der Bearbeitung nicht isoliert 
werden.
3. Reparatur an eigensicheren Komponenten
Legen Sie keine dauerhaften induktiven oder kapazitiven Lasten 
an die Schaltung an, ohne sicherzustellen, dass diese die zulässige 
Spannung und den zulässigen Strom für das verwendete Gerät nicht 
überschreiten.
Eigensichere Komponenten sind die einzigen, an denen gearbeitet 
werden kann, während sie sich in einer entflammbaren Atmosphäre 
befinden. Das Testgerät muss über die richtige Leistung verfügen. 
Ersetzen Sie Komponenten nur durch vom Hersteller angegebene 
Teile. Andere Teile können dazu führen, dass Kältemittel in der 
Atmosphäre durch ein Leck entzündet wird.
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 242 ---
242 / 396 DE
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
4. Verkabelung
Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Verkabelung keinem Verschleiß, 
Korrosion, übermäßigem Druck, Vibrationen, scharfen Kanten 
oder anderen schädlichen Umwelteinflüssen ausgesetzt ist. 
Bei der Überprüfung sind auch die Auswirkungen von Alterung 
oder ständigen Vibrationen von Quellen wie Kompressoren oder 
Ventilatoren zu berücksichtigen.
5. Erkennung von brennbaren Kältemitteln
Unter keinen Umständen dürfen potentielle Zündquellen bei der 
Suche oder Erkennung von Kältemittellecks verwendet werden. 
Eine Halogenlampe (oder ein anderer Detektor mit offener Flamme) 
darf nicht verwendet werden.
6. Leckerkennungsmethoden
Die folgenden Leckerkennungsmethoden gelten für Systeme, die 
brennbare Kältemittel enthalten, als akzeptabel. Elektronische 
Leckerkennungsgeräte müssen zum Erkennen brennbarer 
Kältemittel verwendet werden. Die Empfindlichkeit ist jedoch 
möglicherweise nicht ausreichend oder muss neu kalibriert werden. 
(Das Erkennungsgerät muss in einem kältemittelfreien Bereich 
kalibriert werden.) Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Leckerkennungsgerät 
keine potenzielle Zündquelle ist und für das verwendete Kältemittel 
geeignet ist. Das Leckerkennungsgerät muss auf einen Prozentsatz 
der LFL des Kältemittels eingestellt und auf das eingesetzte 
Kältemittel kalibriert werden und der entsprechende Gasanteil 
(maximal 25 %) wird bestätigt. Leckerkennungsflüssigkeiten 
sind für die meisten Kältemittel geeignet. Die Verwendung von 
chlorhaltigen Reinigungsmitteln ist jedoch zu vermeiden, da das 
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 243 ---
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
243 / 396 DE
Chlor mit dem Kältemittel reagieren und die Kupferrohrleitungen 
korrodieren kann. Wenn ein Leck vermutet wird, müssen alle offenen 
Flammen entfernt/gelöscht werden. Wenn ein Leck des Kältemittels 
festgestellt wird, das gelötet werden muss, muss das gesamte 
Kältemittel aus dem System entfernt oder (durch Absperrventile) 
in einem vom Leck entfernten Teil des Systems isoliert werden. 
Sauerstofffreier Stickstoff muss dann sowohl vor als auch während 
des Lötvorgangs durch das System gespült werden.
7. Entfernung und Entleerung
Beim Eingreifen in den Kältemittelkreislauf zur Durchführung von 
Reparaturen - oder für jeden anderen Zweck - sind konventionelle 
Verfahren zu verwenden. Es ist jedoch wichtig, dass die beste 
Praxis befolgt wird, da die Entflammbarkeit ein wichtiger Aspekt 
ist. Das folgende Verfahren muss eingehalten werden: Kältemittel 
entfernen; den Kreislauf mit Inertgas spülen; evakuieren; 
erneut mit Inertgas spülen; den Kreislauf durch Schneiden oder 
Hartlöten öffnen. Die Kältemittelfüllung muss in die richtigen 
Rückgewinnungszylinder zurückgewonnen werden. Das System 
muss mit OFN gespült werden, um das Gerät sicher zu machen. 
Dieser Vorgang muss möglicherweise mehrmals wiederholt werden. 
Druckluft oder Sauerstoff dürfen für diese Aufgabe nicht verwendet 
werden. Die Spülung muss erreicht werden, indem das Vakuum 
im System mit OFN unterbrochen und bis zum Erreichen des 
Arbeitsdrucks weiter gefüllt wird. Anschließend wird die Atmosphäre 
entlüftet und anschließend auf ein Vakuum abgesenkt. Dieser 
Vorgang muss wiederholt werden, bis sich kein Kältemittel mehr im 
System befindet. Wenn die endgültige OFN-Befüllung verwendet wird, 
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 244 ---
244 / 396 DE
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
muss das System auf Atmosphärendruck entlüftet werden, damit 
Arbeiten durchgeführt werden können. Dieser Vorgang ist absolut 
unerlässlich, wenn Lötarbeiten an den Rohrleitungen durchgeführt 
werden sollen.
Stellen Sie sicher, dass sich der Auslass der Vakuumpumpe nicht in 
der Nähe von Zündquellen befindet und entsprechende Belüftung 
vorhanden ist.
8. Ladeverfahren
Zusätzlich zu herkömmlichen Ladeverfahren sind die folgenden 
Anforderungen zu beachten.
 -
Stellen Sie sicher, dass bei der Verwendung von Ladegeräten 
keine Kontamination verschiedener Kältemittel auftritt. 
Schläuche oder Leitungen müssen so kurz wie möglich sein, um 
die Menge an Kältemittel zu minimieren.
 -
Flaschen sind aufrecht zu halten.
 -
Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Kühlsystem geerdet ist, bevor Sie das 
System mit Kältemittel befüllen.
 -
Kennzeichnen Sie das System, wenn der Ladevorgang 
abgeschlossen ist (falls noch nicht geschehen).
 -
Es ist äußerst sorgfältig darauf zu achten, dass das Kühlsystem 
nicht überfüllt wird.
Vor dem Aufladen des Systems muss es mit OFN einem Drucktest 
unterzogen werden. Das System muss nach Abschluss des 
Ladevorgangs, aber vor der Inbetriebnahme, auf Dichtheit geprüft 
werden. Vor dem Verlassen des Standortes muss eine Leckprüfung 
durchgeführt werden.
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 245 ---
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
245 / 396 DE
9. Außerbetriebnahme
Bevor Sie dieses Verfahren durchführen, ist es wichtig, dass der 
Techniker mit dem Gerät und allen Details genau vertraut ist. Es 
wird empfohlen, alle Kältemittel sicher zurückzugewinnen. Bevor 
die Aufgabe ausgeführt wird, muss eine Öl- und Kältemittelprobe 
genommen werden, falls vor der Wiederverwendung von 
aufgearbeitetem Kältemittel eine Analyse erforderlich ist. Es ist 
wichtig, dass vor Beginn der Arbeiten ein Stromanschluss zur 
Verfügung steht. 
a) Machen Sie sich mit dem Gerät und seiner Bedienung vertraut.
b) Isolieren Sie das System elektrisch.
c)  Vor Beginn des Verfahrens ist sicherzustellen, dass: 
mechanische Handhabungsausrüstung für die Handhabung 
von Kältemittelzylindern vorhanden ist, falls erforderlich; 
die gesamte persönliche Schutzausrüstung vorhanden ist 
und korrekt verwendet wird; der Rückgewinnungsprozess 
jederzeit von einer sachkundigen Person überwacht wird; 
die Rückgewinnungsausrüstung und der Zylinder den 
entsprechenden Normen entsprechen.
d) Wenn möglich, sollten Sie das Kältemittelsystem abpumpen.
e) Wenn kein Vakuum möglich ist, erstellen Sie einen Verteiler,

11.  Rückgewinnung
Beim Entfernen von Kältemittel aus einem System – entweder 
zur Wartung oder Außerbetriebnahme – wird empfohlen, das 
gesamte Kältemittel sicher zu entfernen. Stellen Sie beim 
Umfüllen von Kältemittel in Flaschen sicher, dass nur geeignete 
Kältemittelrückgewinnungsflaschen verwendet werden. 
Stellen Sie sicher, dass die richtige Anzahl von Flaschen zur 
Aufnahme des gesamten Systeminhalts zur Verfügung steht. 
Alle zu verwendenden Flaschen müssen für das rückgewonnene 
Kältemittel bestimmt und für dieses Kältemittel gekennzeichnet 
sein (d. h. spezielle Flaschen für die Rückgewinnung von Kältemittel). 
Die Flaschen müssen mit einem Überdruckventil und zugehörigen 
Absperrventilen in einwandfreiem Zustand ausgestattet sein. Leere 
Rückgewinnungsflaschen werden evakuiert und wenn möglich 
gekühlt, bevor die Rückgewinnung erfolgt.
Die Rückgewinnungsausrüstung muss in einem einwandfreien 
Zustand sein und Anweisungen für das vorhandene Gerät 
enthalten. Sie muss für die Rückgewinnung brennbarer Kältemittel 
geeignet sein.Darüber hinaus müssen kalibrierte Waagen verfügbar 
und in einwandfreiem Zustand sein. Die Schläuche müssen mit 
leckfreien Trennkupplungen versehen sein und sich in gutem 
Zustand befinden. Vergewissern Sie sich vor dem Einsatz des 
Rückgewinnungsgeräts, dass es in einwandfreiem Zustand ist, 
ordnungsgemäß gewartet wurde und dass alle zugehörigen 
elektrischen Komponenten versiegelt sind, um im Falle einer 
Kältemittelfreisetzung eine Entzündung zu verhindern. Wenden Sie 
sich im Zweifelsfall an den Hersteller. 
1  Sicherheitshinweise

--- Page 248 ---
248 / 396 DE
Mobiles Klimagerät / Bedienungsanleitung
Das rückgewonnene Kältemittel muss in der richtigen 
Rückgewinnungsflasche an den Kältemittellieferanten 
zurückgegeben und es muss ein entsprechender 
Entsorgungsnachweis ausgestellt werden. Mischen Sie kein 
Kältemittel in Rückgewinnungsgeräten und insbesondere nicht in 
Flaschen. 
Wenn Kompressoren oder Kompressoröle entfernt werden sollen, 
stellen Sie sicher, dass sie auf ein akzeptables Niveau evakuiert 
wurden, um sicherzustellen, dass kein brennbares Kältemittel 
im Schmiermittel verbleibt. Der Evakuierungsprozess muss vor 
der Rückgabe des Kompressors an den Lieferanten durchgeführt 
werden. Zur Beschleunigung dieses Vorgangs darf nur eine 
elektrische Beheizung des Kompressorgehäuses eingesetzt werden.
Wenn Öl aus einem System abgelassen wird, muss dieser Vorgang 
sicher durchgeführt werden.

Kompetenz des Wartungspersonals
Allgemeines
Wenn Geräte mit brennbaren Kältemitteln betroffen sind, ist 
zusätzlich zu den üblichen Reparaturverfahren für Kühlgeräte eine 
spezielle Schulung erforderlich.
In vielen Ländern wird diese Ausbildung von nationalen 
Ausbildungsorganisationen durchgeführt, die für die Vermittlung 
der entsprechenden nationalen Kompetenzstandards, die in der 
Gesetzgebung festgelegt sein können, akkreditiert sind.
Die erreichte Kompetenz sollte durch ein Zertifikat dokumentiert 
werden.

Schulung
Die Schulung sollte den Inhalt der folgenden Punkte umfassen:
Informationen über das Explosionspotenzial entflammbarer 
Kältemittel, um zu zeigen, dass entflammbare Stoffe bei 
unvorsichtigem Umgang gefährlich sein können.
Informationen über potenzielle Zündquellen, insbesondere solche, 
die nicht offensichtlich sind, wie z. B. Feuerzeuge, Lichtschalter, 
Staubsauger, elektrische Heizgeräte.
Informationen über die verschiedenen Sicherheitskonzepte:
Unbelüftet - (siehe Abschnitt GG.2) Die Sicherheit des Gerätes 
hängt nicht von der Belüftung des Gehäuses ab. Das Ausschalten 
des Gerätes oder das Öffnen des Gehäuses hat keinen wesentlichen 
Einfluss auf die Sicherheit. Dennoch ist es möglich, dass sich 
austretendes Kältemittel im Inneren des Gehäuses ansammelt 
und beim Öffnen des Gehäuses eine entzündliche Atmosphäre 
freigesetzt wird.
Belüftetes Gehäuse - (siehe Abschnitt GG.4) Die Sicherheit des 
Gerätes hängt von der Belüftung des Gehäuses ab. Das Ausschalten 
des Gerätes oder das Öffnen des Gehäuses hat einen wesentlichen 
Einfluss auf die Sicherheit. Zuvor sollte für eine ausreichende 
Belüftung gesorgt werden.
Belüfteter Raum - (siehe Abschnitt GG.5) Die Sicherheit des Gerätes 
hängt von der Belüftung des Raumes ab. Das Ausschalten des 
Gerätes oder das Öffnen des Gehäuses hat keinen wesentlichen 
Einfluss auf die Sicherheit. Die Belüftung des Raumes darf während 
der Reparaturarbeiten nicht abgeschaltet werden.

7.4  Wasser-voll-Alarm
Die innere Wasserschale in dem mobilen Klimagerät hat einen Wasserstands-Sicherheitsschalter, 
der den Wasserstand überwacht. Wenn der Wasserstand eine erwartete Höhe erreicht, leuchtet die 
Anzeige auf, dass ein hoher Wasserstand erreicht wurde. (Wenn die Wasserpumpe beschädigt ist 
und das Wasser voll ist, entfernen Sie bitte den Gummistopfen an der Unterseite des Geräts und das 
gesamte Wasser wird nach außen abgelassen).
A
B
Die sich oben befindende Öffnung (A) dient zum Absaugen des Wassers aus dem mobilen Klimagerät 
(entfernen Sie den Gummistopfen und fügen Sie den Ablaufschlauch an der Öffnung hinzu), wenn 
viel Feuchtigkeit im Raum ist (bei kontinuierlicher Entleerung) oder wenn das Produkt im Modus 
Dehumidification (Entfeuchtung) oder Heating (Heizen) betrieben wird.
Die sich am Boden befindende Öffnung (B) hat einen Tank und ist dann zu benutzen, wenn der Tank 
entleert werden muss (Wassertank-Alarm). Entfernen Sie einfach den Gummistopfen und fügen Sie 
den Ablassschlauch in die Öffnung ein, um das Wasser aus dem Tank abzulassen.
C
Hinweis: 
Beachten Sie, dass je nach Füllung des Wassertanks manchmal sehr viel Wasser 
abgelassen werden muss. In diesem Fall wäre es ideal, ihn nach draußen oder über 
einem großen Becken zu entleeren, damit Ihr Zimmer nicht überflutet wird.

não fique alterada de tal forma que o nível de proteção fique 
afetado. Isto deverá incluir os danos em cabos, número excessivo 
de ligações, terminais não fabricados em conformidade com as 
especificações originais, danos nas vedações, ajuste incorreto de 
bucins, etc. Garantir que o aparelho é montado com segurança. 
Garantir que as vedações ou os materiais de vedação não se 
deterioraram de tal forma que já não sejam úteis para impedir 
a entrada de atmosferas inflamáveis. As peças sobresselentes 
devem estar em conformidade com as especificações do 
fabricante. 
C
Nota: 
A utilização de vedante de silicone pode inibir a 
eficácia de alguns tipos de equipamento de deteção de 
vazamento. Os componentes intrinsecamente seguros 
não necessitam de ser isolados, antes de se trabalhar neles.
3. Reparação de componentes intrinsecamente seguros
Não deve ser aplicada nenhuma carga permanente de indução ou 
capacitância no circuito, sem garantir que isso não excede a tensão 
e a corrente permitidas para o equipamento em utilização.
Os componentes intrinsecamente seguros são os únicos em que se 
pode trabalhar sob tensão elétrica, na presença de uma atmosfera 
inflamável. O aparelho de teste deve apresentar classificação 
correta. Substituir os componentes apenas com peças especificadas 
pelo fabricante. A utilização de outras peças pode provocar a ignição 
do agente refrigerante na atmosfera, devido a vazamento.

Ar-Condicionado móvel / Manual de Utilizador
297 / 396 PT
4. Cablagem
Verificar se a cablagem não apresenta indícios de desgaste, 
corrosão, pressão excessiva, vibração, extremidades afiadas 
ou quaisquer outros efeitos ambientais adversos. A verificação 
também deve tomar em consideração os efeitos do envelhecimento 
ou da vibração contínua, originada por fontes como, por exemplo, 
compressores ou ventoinhas.
5. Deteção de agentes refrigerantes inflamáveis
Não devem ser utilizadas, em nenhuma circunstância, potenciais 
fontes de ignição para a pesquisa ou deteção de vazamento de 
agente refrigerante. Não deve ser utilizada nenhuma tocha de 
haleto (nem qualquer outros detetor que utilize chama livre).
1  Aviso de segurança

--- Page 298 ---
298 / 396 PT
Ar-Condicionado móvel / Manual de Utilizador
6. Métodos de deteção de vazamento
Os seguintes métodos de deteção de vazamento são considerados 
aceitáveis para sistemas que contenham agentes refrigerantes 
inflamáveis. Devem ser utilizados detetores de vazamento 
eletrónicos para detetar refrigerantes inflamáveis, mas a 
sensibilidade pode não ser adequada ou pode ser necessário 
recalibrar. (O equipamento de deteção deve ser calibrado numa área 
sem refrigerante.) Certifique-se de que o detetor não é uma fonte 
potencial de ignição e é adequado para o refrigerante utilizado. 
O equipamento de deteção de vazamentos deve ser regulado 
para uma percentagem do LFL do agente refrigerante e deve ser 
calibrado para o agente refrigerante utilizado, bem como deve ser 
confirmada a percentagem adequada de gás (25% no máximo).  
Os fluidos de deteção de vazamentos são adequados para utilização 
com a maioria dos agentes refrigerantes, porém deve ser evitada a 
utilização de detergentes que incluam cloro, dado que o cloro pode 
reagir com o agente refrigerante e corroer a tubagem de cobre.  
Em caso de suspeita de vazamento, todas as chamas vivas devem 
ser removidas/extintas. Caso seja encontrado algum vazamento de 
refrigerante que necessite de soldadura forte, todo o refrigerante 
deverá ser removido do sistema ou isolado (através de corte) numa 
parte do sistema afastada do vazamento. O nitrogénio isento de 
oxigénio (OFN) deve então ser purgado através do sistema antes e 
durante o processo de soldadura forte.

7. Remoção e evacuação
Quando for necessário trabalhar no circuito de refrigeração para 
fazer reparações, ou para qualquer outro fim, devem ser utilizados 
procedimentos convencionais. No entanto, é importante que as 
melhores práticas sejam seguidas, visto a inflamabilidade ser uma 
possibilidade. Os seguintes procedimentos devem ser respeitados: 
remover o refrigerante; purgar o circuito com gás inerte; evacuar; 
purgar novamente com gás inerte; abrir o circuito por meio de corte 
ou brasagem. A carga de agente refrigerante deve ser recuperada 
para os cilindros de recuperação corretos. O sistema deve ser 
abastecido com OFN para tornar a unidade segura. Este processo 
pode precisar de ser repetido várias vezes. Não se deve utilizar 
ar ou oxigénio comprimido para esta tarefa. O abastecimento 
deve ser conseguido, interrompendo o vácuo no sistema com 
OFN e continuando a encher até que a pressão de funcionamento 
seja atingida, ventilando então para a atmosfera e, finalmente, 
arrastando para o vácuo. Este processo deverá ser repetido até 
que não se encontre agente refrigerante no sistema. Quando for 
utilizada a carga final de OFN, o sistema deve ser ventilado até ao 
nível de pressão atmosférica, para permitir que comece a funcionar. 
Esta operação é absolutamente vital se estiverem a ser realizados 
trabalhos de soldagem na tubagem.
Deve garantir-se que a saída da bomba de vácuo não se encontra 
fechada para nenhuma fonte de ignição e de que há ventilação 
disponível.

(caso ainda não esteja).
 -
Deve ser tomado extremo cuidado para não encher em excesso o 
sistema de refrigeração.
Antes de recarregar o sistema, deve ser efetuado teste de pressão 
com OFN. O sistema deve ser testado relativamente a vazamentos 
após conclusão do carregamento, porém antes de ser colocado em 
funcionamento. Deve ser executado um teste de vazamento de 
acompanhamento antes de abandonar o local.

Upozorenja (samo za upotrebu rashladnog sredstva R290)
1. Opće upute
1.1  Provjere područja
Prije početka radova na sustavima sa zapaljivim rashladnim 
sredstvima potrebno je osigurati da opasnost od zapaljenja bude 
minimalna. Za popravak rashladnog sustava, potrebno je pridržavati 
se sljedećih mjera predostrožnosti prije obavljanja radova na sustavu.
1.2  Postupak rada
Rad se mora izvoditi kontroliranim postupkom kako bi se smanjio 
rizik prisutnosti zapaljivog plina ili pare tijekom rada.
1.3  Područje rada
Svo servisno osoblje i drugi koji rade u okolnom području moraju 
dobiti upute o prirodi rada koji se izvršava. Izbjegavajte rad u 
skučenim prostorima. Područje oko radnog prostora mora se odvojiti. 
Provjerite jesu li uvjeti unutar područja sigurni nakon uspostavljanja 
kontrole nad zapaljivim materijalima.
1.4 Provjera prisutnosti zapaljivog rashladnog sredstva
Područje se provjerava prikladnim detektorom za rashladno 
sredstvo prije i tijekom rada kako bi se osiguralo da tehničar bude 
svjestan potencijalno zapaljivih atmosfera. Osigurajte da je oprema 
za otkrivanje curenja koja se koristi odgovarajuća za upotrebu 
sa zapaljivim rashladnim sredstvima, tj. da nema iskrenja, da je 
zatvorena na odgovarajući način ili samosigurna.

Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
1.5  Aparat za gašenje požara
Ako je potrebno izvesti toplu obradu na rashladnoj opremi ili 
povezanim dijelovima, prikladna oprema za gašenje požara mora biti 
dostupna u blizini. Držite aparat za gašenje sa suhim praškom ili CO
2
 
u blizini mjesta gdje se odvija punjenje.
1.6 Bez izvora paljenja
Nijedna osoba koja obavlja radove na rashladnom sustavu koji 
podrazumijevaju izlaganje cjevovoda koji sadrži ili je sadržavao 
rashladno sredstvo ne smije koristiti izvore paljenja na način koji 
može dovesti do opasnosti od požara ili eksplozije. Sve moguće 
izvore paljenja, uključujući pušenje cigareta, potrebno je držati 
na dovoljnoj udaljenosti od mjesta na kojem se obavlja ugradnja, 
popravak, uklanjanje i odlaganje, a za vrijeme čega bi se zapaljiva 
rashladna sredstva mogla ispustiti u okolni prostor. Prije obavljanja 
radova područje oko opreme potrebno je pregledati kako bi se 
osiguralo da ne postoje opasnosti od zapaljenja. Obavezno je 
postaviti znakove ZABRANJENO PUŠENJE.
1.7  Prozračeno područje
Osigurajte da je područje na otvorenom ili da je na odgovarajući način 
ventilirano prije otvaranja sustava ili izvođenja tople obrade. Mora 
se održavati određena razina prozračenosti za vrijeme izvođenja 
radova. Ventilacija bi trebala raspršiti bilo kakvo rashladno sredstvo 
na siguran način i, po mogućnosti, izbaciti ga u van u atmosferu.

1.8 Provjere opreme za rashladno sredstvo
Kada se mijenjaju električni dijelovi, oni moraju odgovarati svrsi i biti 
ispravnih specifikacija. Obvezno je pratiti smjernice za održavanje 
i servis proizvođača u svakom trenutku. Ako imate nedoumica, 
obratite se tehničkom odjelu proizvođača za pomoć. Na instalacije 
koje koriste zapaljive rashladne tvari primjenjuju se sljedeće 
provjere: veličina punjenja u skladu je s veličinom prostorije u koju 
su ugrađeni dijelovi koji sadrže rashladno sredstvo; uređaji i izlazi 
za ventilaciju ispravni su i nisu začepljeni; ako se koristi neizravni 
rashladni krug, u sekundarnom krugu mora se provjeriti prisutnost 
rashladnog sredstva; označavanje na opremi mora biti vidljivo i čitko. 
Oznake i znakovi koji su nečitki moraju se ispraviti; rashladna cijev 
ili dijelovi ugrađuju se u položaj u kojem je malo vjerojatno da će biti 
izloženi bilo kojoj tvari koja može nagrizati komponente koje sadrže 
rashladno sredstvo, osim ako su komponente izrađene od materijala 
koji su sami po sebi otporni na koroziju ili su na odgovarajući način 
zaštićene od korozije.
1.9 Provjere električnih uređaja
Popravljanje i održavanje električnih dijelova mora obuhvaćati prve 
sigurnosne provjere i postupke pregledavanja dijelova. Ako postoji 
nedostatak koji bi mogao ugroziti sigurnost, obavezno je isključiti 
napajanje do kruga dok se nedostatak ne ukloni na zadovoljavajući 
način. Ako se nedostatak ne može ispraviti odmah, a potrebno 
je nastaviti s radom, obvezno je primijeniti prikladno privremeno 
rješenje. O tome je obavezno obavijestiti vlasnika opreme tako da 
sve stranke budu informirane.
1  Sigurnosna upozorenja

--- Page 352 ---
352 / 396 HR
Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
Početne provjere sigurnosti uključuju: pražnjenje kondenzatora: 
to se mora učiniti na siguran način kako bi se izbjegla mogućnost 
iskrenja; da tijekom punjenja, vađenja ili pročišćavanja sustava 
električne komponente i ožičenje pod naponom nisu izloženi; da 
postoji kontinuitet uzemljenja.
2. Popravci zatvorenih dijelova
2.1  Prilikom izvođenja popravaka na zatvorenim dijelovima, 
napajanje do opreme se mora prekinuti prije uklanjanja 
zatvorenih poklopaca, itd. Ako je zaista nužno da napajanje bude 
spojeno tijekom servisiranja, onda je obvezno postaviti stalno 
rješenje za otkrivanje curenja na mjestu gdje postoji najveća 
opasnost od curenja kako bi se pravovremeno moglo uočiti 
potencijalno opasnu situaciju.
2.2 Posebnu pažnju potrebno je obratiti na sljedeće kako biste 
osigurali da prilikom rada na električnim dijelovima ne dođe do 
izmjena na kućištu koje bi ugrozile razinu zaštite. To obuhvaća 
oštećenje kabela, prekomjeran broj spojeva, redne stezaljke 
koje nisu izvedene prema izvornim specifikacijama, oštećenje 
brtvi, neispravno postavljanje brtvenica itd. Pobrinite se da je 
uređaj sigurno postavljen. Provjerite jesu li brtve ili materijali 
za brtvljenje ispravni, tj. mogu li još uvijek služiti svrsi, a to je 
sprječavanje ulaska zapaljivih atmosfera. Zamjena dijelova treba 
se obaviti u skladu sa specifikacijama proizvođača.

Napomena: 
Upotreba silikonskog brtvila može ograničiti 
učinkovitost nekih vrsta opreme za detekciju curenja. 
Samosigurni dijelovi ne moraju se izolirati prije izvođenja 
radova na njima.
3. Popravak samosigurnih dijelova
Nemojte trajno induktivno ili kapacitivnoopteretiti krug bez da prije 
toga niste sigurni da to neće premašiti napon i struju dopuštenu za 
opremu koja se koristi.
Samosigurni dijelovi jedini su dijelovi na kojima se može raditi u 
zapaljivoj atmosferi dok je napajanje uključeno. Uređaj za ispitivanje 
mora biti ispravne snage. Dijelove zamjenjujte samo s dijelovima 
koje je naveo proizvođač. Upotreba drugih dijelova može dovesti do 
zapaljenja rashladnog sredstva u zapaljivoj atmosferi ako dođe do 
curenja.
4. Kabeli
Provjerite da kabeli nisu izloženi trošenju, korozivnom djelovanju, 
prekomjernom tlaku, vibracijama, oštrim rubovima ili bilo kakvim 
drugim štetnim učincima iz okoline. Provjera također podrazumijeva 
uzimanje u obzir učinaka starenja ili neprestanih vibracija nastalih iz 
izvora tako što su kompresori ili ventilatori.
5. Otkrivanje zapaljivih rashladnih sredstava
Nikada nemojte koristiti moguće izvore paljenja za traženje ili 
otkrivanje izvora curenja rashladnog sredstva. Ne smiju se koristiti 
detektori s otvorenim plamenom.

354 / 396 HR
Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
6. Načini za otkrivanje curenja
Sljedeći načini za otkrivanje curenja smatraju se prihvatljivima 
za sustave koji sadrže zapaljiva rashladna sredstva. Elektronički 
detektori curenja koriste se za otkrivanje zapaljivih rashladnih 
sredstava, no njihova osjetljivost možda nije odgovarajuća ili treba 
ponovnu kalibraciju. (Oprema za detektiranje mora se kalibrirati 
u prostoru bez rashladnog sredstva.) Osigurajte da detektor 
ne djeluje kao potencijalni izvor paljenja i da je odgovarajući za 
rashladno sredstvo. Oprema za otkrivanje curenja mora se postaviti 
na postotak donje granice zapaljivosti rashladnog sredstva i mora 
se kalibrirati prema korištenom rashladnom sredstvu te se treba 
potvrditi odgovarajući postotak plina (najviše 25 %). Tekućine za 
otkrivanje curenja prikladne su za upotrebu na većini rashladnih 
sredstava, ali se mora izbjegavati upotreba deterdženata koji sadrže 
klor jer klor može reagirati s rashladnim sredstvom i korozivno 
djelovati na bakrene cijevi. Ako postoji sumnja da je došlo do curenja, 
svi izvori otvorenog plamena moraju se ukloniti ili ugasiti. Ako se 
otkrije curenje rashladnog sredstva zbog kojeg je potrebno tvrdo 
lemljenje, svo se rashladno sredstvo treba izvaditi iz sustava ili 
izolirati (pomoću zapornih ventila) u dio sustava koji je udaljen od 
mjesta curenja. Dušik bez kisika (OFN) treba se pustiti kroz sustav 
prije i za vrijeme procesa tvrdog lemljenja.

Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
355 / 396 HR
7. Uklanjanje i pražnjenje
Pri otvaranju rashladnog kruga radi popravaka – ili u bilo koju drugu 
svrhu – koriste se konvencionalni postupci. Međutim, važno je 
koristiti najbolje prakse jer postoji mogućnost zapaljenja. Potrebno je 
učiniti sljedeće: ukloniti rashladno sredstvo; pročistiti krug inertnim 
plinom; isprazniti; ponovno pročistiti inertnim plinom; otvoriti krug 
rezanjem ili lemljenjem. Punjenje rashladnog sredstva mora se 
izvaditi u ispravne cilindre. Sustav se treba pročistiti dušikom bez 
kisika (OFN) kako bi uređaj bio siguran. Postupak će se možda morati 
ponoviti nekoliko puta. U postupku se ne smije koristiti komprimirani 
zrak ili kisik. Pročišćavanje se mora postići prekidanjem vakuuma u 
sustavu dušikom bez kisika (OFN) i punjenjem dok se ne postigne 
radni tlak, a zatim pražnjenjem u atmosferu te u konačnici vraćanjem 
u vakuum. Taj se postupak mora ponavljati dok u sustavu više ne 
bude rashladnog sredstva. Kada se iskoristi zadnje punjenje dušika 
bez kisika (OFN), sustav se mora ispustiti do razine atmosferskog 
tlaka kako bi se mogao omogućiti rad. To je iznimno važno ako se 
planira izvođenje tvrdog lemljenja na cjevovodu.
Osigurajte da utičnica za vakuumsku pumpu ne bude u blizini izvora 
paljenja te da je dostupna ventilacija.

Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
8. Postupci punjenja
Osim konvencionalnih postupaka punjenja, obavezno je pridržavati 
se sljedećih uvjeta.
 -
Osigurajte da ne dođe do kontaminacije drugim rashladnim 
sredstvima kada budete koristili opremu za punjenje. Crijeva i 
vodovi moraju biti što kraći kako biste smanjili potrebnu količinu 
rashladnog sredstva koja se treba nalaziti u njima.
 -
Cilindri moraju biti uspravni.
 -
Osigurajte da rashladni sustav bude uzemljen prije punjenja 
sustava rashladnim sredstvom.
 -
Označite sustav kada završite punjenje (ako već nije obilježen).
 -
Potrebno je pripaziti da ne prepunite sustav rashladnim sredstvom.
Prije ponovnog punjenja sustava potrebno je ispitati tlak dušikom 
bez kisika (OFN). Obvezno je ispitati curi li plin iz sustava nakon 
dovršetka punjenja, a prije puštanja u pogon. Naknadno ispitivanje 
za curenje izvodi se prije napuštanja mjesta rada.
9. Stavljanje izvan pogona
Prije izvođenja tog postupka važno da tehničar bude u potpunosti 
upoznat s opremom i svim pojedinostima iste. Preporučena je dobra 
praksa da se sva rashladna sredstva izvade iz sustava na siguran 
način. Prije izvođenja zadatka uzima se uzorak ulja i rashladnog 
sredstva u slučaju da je potrebna analiza prije ponovne upotrebe 
izvađenog rashladnog sredstva. Od ključne je važnosti da napajanje 
bude spojeno prije započinjanja zadatka. 
1  Sigurnosna upozorenja

357 / 396 HR
a) Upoznajte se s opremom i funkcijom te opreme.
b) Električki izolirajte sustav.
c)  Prije postupka osigurajte: dostupnost opreme za mehaničko 
rukovanje cilindrima rashladnog sredstva (po potrebi); 
dostupnost i ispravno korištenje sve osobne zaštitne 
opreme; neprekidan nadzor postupka vađenja od strane 
kvalificirane osobe; usklađenost opreme za vađenje i cilindara s 
odgovarajućim standardima.
d) Ako je moguće, ispumpajte rashladni sustav.
e) Ako nije moguće postići vakuum, ugradite razdjelni priključak 
tako da se rashladno sredstvo može ukloniti iz različitih dijelova 
sustava.
f)  Postavite cilindar na vagu prije pražnjenja.
g) Pokrenite stroj za pražnjenje i koristite ga u skladu s uputama 
proizvođača.
h) Nemojte prepuniti cilindre. (Ne više od 80 % obujma kada se 
puni tekućinom).
i)  Nemojte prekoračiti maksimalni radni tlak cilindra, čak ni 
privremeno.
j)  Nakon što se cilindri pravilno napune i postupak dovrši, 
osigurajte da se cilindri, kao i oprema, odmah uklone s mjesta 
rada te da se svi izolacijski ventili na opremi zatvore.
k)  Izvađeno rashladno sredstvo ne smije se staviti u drugi 
rashladni sustav osim ako se prethodno ne očisti i provjeri.

Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
10.  Označavanje
Na opremi je potrebno označiti da je prestala s radom te da je iz 
nje ispražnjeno rashladno sredstvo. Oznaka mora biti datirana i 
potpisana.
Osigurajte da se na opremi koriste oznake na kojima je istaknuto da 
oprema sadrži zapaljivo rashladno sredstvo.
11.  Vađenje
Kada uklanjate rashladno sredstvo iz sustava, bilo to za potrebe 
servisa ili za stavljanje izvan pogona, preporučuje se dobra praksa da 
se rashladna sredstva uklone na siguran način. Prilikom prebacivanja 
rashladnog sredstva u cilindre, osigurajte da se koriste isključivo 
odgovarajući cilindri za vađenje rashladnog sredstva. Osigurajte da je 
dostupan točan broj cilindara potreban za pohranu cijelog punjenja 
iz sustava. Svi cilindri koji će se koristiti trebaju biti namijenjeni za 
izvađeno rashladno sredstvo i obilježeni za to rashladno sredstvo 
(npr. posebni cilindri za vađenje rashladnog sredstva). Cilindri moraju 
imati ispravan ventil za ograničenje tlaka i ispravne odgovarajuće 
zaporne ventile. Prazne cilindre za vađenje potrebno je isprazniti i, 
po mogućnosti, ohladiti prije vađenja.
Oprema za vađenje mora biti u ispravnom stanju s uputama o opremi 
koja vam je pri ruci te mora biti prikladna za vađenje zapaljivih 
rashladnih sredstava. Osim toga, na raspolaganju mora biti komplet 
kalibriranih vaga u dobrom radnom stanju. Crijeva trebaju imati 
nepropusne spojke za odvajanje u dobrom stanju. Prije upotrebe 
stroja za vađenje provjerite je li stroj u zadovoljavajućem radnom 
stanju, je li održavan na odgovarajući način i jesu li svi pripadajući 
1  Sigurnosna upozorenja

Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
359 / 396 HR
električni dijelovi zatvoreni kako bi se spriječilo paljenje u slučaju 
da dođe do ispuštanja rashladnog sredstva. Posavjetujte se s 
proizvođačem ako imate nedoumica. 
Izvađeno rashladno sredstvo mora se vratiti dobavljaču za rashladna 
sredstva u odgovarajućem cilindru za vađenje rashladnog sredstva 
i uz odgovarajuću bilješku o prijenosu otpada. Nemojte miješati 
rashladna sredstva u jedinicama određenim za vađenje, a posebno 
ne u cilindrima. 
Ako je potrebno ukloniti kompresore ili ulja kompresora, provjerite 
jesu li ispražnjeni do prihvatljive razine kako biste osigurali da 
zapaljivo rashladno sredstvo ne ostane u mazivu. Postupak 
pražnjenja obavlja se prije vraćanja kompresora dobavljačima. Za 
ubrzanje postupka smije se koristiti isključivo električno grijanje 
kućišta kompresora. Kada se iz sustava ispušta ulje, to se mora 
provoditi na siguran način.

Stručnost servisnog osoblja
Općenito
Uz uobičajene postupke popravljanja rashladne opreme potrebna je 
posebna obuka za opremu sa zapaljivim rashladnim sredstvima.
U mnogim zemljama tu obuku provode nacionalne organizacije za 
osposobljavanje, akreditirane za poučavanje iz područja relevantnih 
nacionalnih standarda kompetencija koji mogu biti propisani 
zakonodavstvom.
Postignuta kompetencija treba biti dokumentirana certifikatom.
Osposobljavanje
Osposobljavanje treba sadržavati sljedeće:
Podaci o eksplozivnom potencijalu zapaljivih rashladnih sredstava 
koji pokazuju da zapaljivi materijali mogu biti opasni ako se njima 
nepažljivo rukuje.
Podaci o potencijalnim izvorima paljenja, posebno onima koji nisu 
očigledni, poput upaljača, prekidača za svjetlo, usisavača, električnih 
grijača.
Informacije o različitim konceptima sigurnosti:
Neprozračeno - (vidi točku GG.2) Sigurnost uređaja ne ovisi o 
prozračivanju kućišta. Isključivanje uređaja ili otvaranje kućišta nema 
značajan utjecaj na sigurnost. Ipak, postoji mogućnost nakupljanja 
rashladnog sredstva koje curi unutar kućišta, a zapaljiva atmosfera 
će se osloboditi pri otvaranju kućišta.
1  Sigurnosna upozorenja

361 / 396 HR
Prozračeno kućište – (vidi točku GG.4) Sigurnost uređaja ovisi o 
prozračenosti kućišta. Isključivanje uređaja ili otvaranje kućišta 
ima značajan utjecaj na sigurnost. Prije toga potrebno je osigurati 
dostatno prozračivanje.
Prozračena prostorija – (vidi točku GG.5) Sigurnost uređaja ovisi o 
prozračenosti prostorije. Isključivanje uređaja ili otvaranje kućišta 
nema značajan utjecaj na sigurnost. Prozračivanje prostorije ne 
smije se isključiti za vrijeme postupaka popravljanja.

Prijenosni klima uređaj / Korisnički priručnik
Kada uređaj koristite u europskim zemljama, morate se pridržavati sljedećih uputa: 
Odlaganje: Nemojte odlagati baterije kao nerazvrstani komunalni otpad. Odvojeno sakupljanje takvog 
otpada nužno je zbog posebne obrade. 
Zabranjeno je odložiti ovaj uređaj s kućnim otpadom. 
Postoji nekoliko mogućnosti za odlaganje: 
 -
Općina ima sustav sakupljanja otpada, prema kojem se elektronički otpad može besplatno 
odložiti. 
 -
Prilikom kupovine novog uređaja prodavatelj će preuzeti stari uređaj bez dodatne naknade. 
 -
Proizvođač će uzeti stari uređaj bez dodatne naknade za korisnika. 
 -
Zbog vrijednih resursa, stari se uređaji mogu prodati trgovcima starim željezom. 
Divlje odlaganje otpada u šumama i prirodu ugrožava vaše zdravlje jer opasne tvari cure u podzemne 
vode te dospijevaju u prehrambeni lanac.
 
Ovaj simbol označava da se ovaj proizvod ne smije odlagati zajedno s ostalim kućanskim otpadom na 
kraju njegovog radnog vijeka. Rabljeni uređaj mora se vratiti na službeno sabirno mjesto za recikliranje 
električnih i elektroničkih uređaja. Da biste pronašli te sustave za prikupljanje, obratite se lokalnim 
vlastima ili prodavaču gdje je proizvod kupljen. Svako kućanstvo igra važnu ulogu u uporabi i recikliranju 
starih uređaja. Odgovarajuće odlaganje iskorištenog aparata pomaže u sprečavanju mogućih 
negativnih posljedica za okoliš i ljudsko zdravlje.

3  Synchronisation du climatiseur mobile avec 
Amazon Alexa
Amazon Echo est une enceinte mains-libres à commande vocale. Elle permet de se connecter au service vocal 
Alexa, le cerveau d’Echo. Désormais, vous pouvez simplement demander à Alexa de régler la température de 
la pièce. Pour cela, il vous suffit de prononcer le mot de sortie de veille «Alexa», et Echo réagit.
Arçelik HomeWhiz intègre le contrôle du climatiseur sans fil dans ses appareils domestiques afin de les 
rendre intelligents et de les doter de la technologie Amazon Alexa. Grâce à la commande vocale, vous 
pouvez contrôler votre climatiseur et profiter d’un confort à domicile.
