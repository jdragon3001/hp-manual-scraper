eCAFÉ™ Slim HD eCAFÉ™ EX HD
8/52 – User Manual
The  password  selected  when  you  turn  your  eCAFÉ™ on  the  first  time  will  become  the
administrator password. Make sure you don't forget it, as the operating system will ask you to enter
it every time an application performs an administrator-level task: adding a user, changing a password
or accessing the safe (for more information, please refer to section 3.3.2. A safe to secure your
passwords).
The administrator password differs from the  password requested  to  connect to a  secure Wi-Fi
network (in  that case,  the password will  be described as  a security  key). For  more information
regarding Wi-Fi networks, please refer to section 3.7.1 Connecting to the Internet via Wi-Fi.
- You can now select the protection mode you require when logging in:
1. Log in automatically: no password is requested when you log in. However, you will be
required to enter the administrator password to access the safe.
2. Require a password to log in: the system will request your user password when you log in,
and you will be required to enter your administrator password to access the safe.
3. Require a password to log in and decrypt your home folder: the system will request
your user password only when you log in. You will not be required to enter the administrator
password to access the safe.
For optimum protection, particularly if you share your computer with other users, we recommend
that you configure your systemto request a password when logging in and accessing the safe (option 2).
- Click Next.
- Wait while the system applies the settings.
You can now access your eCAFÉ™ Desktop.

connectivity options for countless applications).
2.6. Extensive connectivity options for countless applications

General safety rules
Before connecting a device to your netbook, please refer to the installation instructions provided with the
device.
Never remove (disconnect) a device while your eCAFÉ™ is reading or saving data: should you
do so, you risk permanently losing or damaging your data.
USB ports (Universal Serial Bus)

such as a keyboard, a mouse, a USB key and more. This interface is hot-swappable, allowing you to
connect and remove your device without having to first shut it down.

--- Page 15 ---
eCAFÉ™ Slim HD eCAFÉ™ EX HD
User Manual – 15/52

HDMI connector (not available on all versions)
Connect eCAFÉ™ EX HD to an external
monitor or HDTV set equipped with an
HDMI  port  (cable  not  included),  and
enjoy high-definition image display.
2.7. A desktop device AND a mobile device
Both a desktop device and a mobile device, your eCAFÉ™ can be used everywhere, thanks to its dual
power supply capabilities (plugged into an electrical outlet, and battery power).
2.7.1.Operation via an electrical outlet, and charging the battery
Use the included power adapter to supply power to your eCAFÉ™. The power adapter complies with the
specifications of the electrical network in the country in which the device was purchased.
Insert the power adapter into your netbook’s power supply connector until it stops. Do not exert
excessive force on the connector!
When your eCAFÉ™  is plugged  into  an  electrical  outlet,  the  device's  battery  starts  to  charge
automatically. Please note that fully charging eCAFÉ™ while the device is in use requires more time than
when eCAFÉ™ is powered off.
The battery only charges if the battery On/Off switch (BAT) is set to ON. For more information,
please refer to section 2.1. Unpacking your eCAFÉ™ for the first time.

--- Page 17 ---
eCAFÉ™ Slim HD eCAFÉ™ EX HD
User Manual – 17/52
2.7.2.Operation via the built-in battery
eCAFÉ™ is designed to operate via its built-in battery. On a full charge, the battery offers comfortable
battery life.
To  extend  your battery's lifespan,  we recommend that you charge it fully  when  using  your
eCAFÉ™ for the first time. Please refer to the battery charge status indicator for more information
regarding the battery charge level.
2.7.3.Optimizing battery use
The Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) polymer battery in your eCAFÉ™ can be charged at any time using the included
power adapter.
The battery installed in your eCAFÉ™ is fixed in place. Never attempt to remove it or replace it
yourself; by doing so, you risk damaging your netbook. Likewise, using an inappropriate battery may
cause an explosion. Only certified Hercules maintenance centers are able to replace the battery with
a Hercules battery that is identical to the original battery supplied with your netbook.
For more information regarding battery replacement, please refer to:
http://www.ecafe.hercules.com/.
To extend the battery's lifespan:
- If you do not intend to use your computer for several days, set your netbook's battery On/Off switch
(BAT) to OFF. You can access this switch by opening up the cover plate located on the underside of the
netbook. Beforehand, make sure that the battery is charged to 70% of its capacity. Always store your
computer in a room in which the temperature is between 5 and 35°C, and avoid leaving it in a vehicle
parked in direct sunlight. The Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery loses its qualities over time, even if you don't use
it.
- If your eCAFÉ™ is always plugged into an electrical outlet, set the battery's On/Off switch (BAT) to OFF.
You can access this switch by opening up the cover plate located on the underside of the netbook. Doing
so will disconnect the battery from your eCAFÉ™, and you will lose your computer's portable feature. If
you want to take your netbook to another room without turning it off, remember to set the battery's On/Off
switch (BAT) to ON.

- Disable the Wi-Fi feature if you are not accessing a Wi-Fi network. To do so, move the Wi-Fi switch to
the left (the  red  mark  visible  behind  the  switch  indicates  that  Wi-Fi is disabled). The indicator
switches off.
- Configure the power management options in the System/Power Management (Preferences window)
menu.
2.8. Switching off your eCAFÉ™
Turning off your eCAFÉ™
- Before turning off your eCAFÉ™, make sure that all programs and applications have been properly shut
down.
- To turn off your eCAFÉ™, press the power On/Off button located to the top right of the keyboard and
confirm the device's shutdown in the window displayed.
Screensaver mode
Your eCAFÉ™'s display automatically switches to Screensaver mode if the device has not been used for
a certain time. To exit this mode, press any key or touch the touchpad. To access the Screensaver mode
configuration options, open the System menu, then select the Screensaver option in the Preferences
window.
Standby mode
After an extended period without use, your eCAFÉ™ switches to Standby mode. To exit this mode and
start your netbook back up, press the power On/Off switch located to the top right of the keyboard. To
access the Standby  mode configuration  options,  open  the System menu,  then  select  the Power
Management option in the Preferences window.
Forcing the computer to turn off or restart
If you have trouble turning your computer off, press and hold down the device's power On/Off button until
your eCAFÉ™ turns off.
Do not force your computer to shut down or restart when files are open: by doing so, you risk
permanently losing data.

2.9. Restoring your system
If you feel that your eCAFÉ™ no longer provides its  original  level of performance (slower access to
programs, repeated crashes, etc.), you can restore your system: i.e. return it to a "clean" state, identical to
the system installed on your netbook on the day you purchased it. For more information regarding the
system restore feature, please visit http://www.ecafe.hercules.com/.
Prior to performing a system restore, remember to save all your important data to an external
device (USB key, external hard disk drive, etc.). The system restore process will delete all data (audio
and  video  files,  new  programs, updates,  drivers,  preferences,  etc.)  that  you  have  added  to  your
netbook since you first started using your eCAFÉ™.

3.1. An introduction to eCAFÉ™
When  you  start up your netbook,  you  access  the eCAFÉ™  Desktop,  which  contains  a  selection  of
shortcuts leading to your  favorite applications. Other  applications are  also available in  the menu bar

required – ask you for permission to store this information. For more details about protecting your
data and using the safe, please refer to section 3.3. Protecting your eCAFÉ

3.3.2. A safe to secure your passwords (the Keyring)
For enhanced protection, your eCAFÉ
™
also features a safe, which securely stores all the passwords
requested  by  various  applications  (Wi-Fi  networks  management,  websites,  email  and  messaging
programs). The safe itself is protected by a password defined by the computer administrator when the
netbook starts up for the first time (please refer to section 2.2.2. Configuring your eCAFÉ™'s settings
and  administrator  password). Depending on whether  you  are  logged  in  as  an  administrator  or  a
standard user, a window may appear, requesting a password (the administrator password) required by
some applications attempting to store or search for a password.
The main applications liable to store passwords are the following: some websites which request a
password to grant access to a page; and the Wi-Fi networks management application, which requests a
key to connect to a secure network.
