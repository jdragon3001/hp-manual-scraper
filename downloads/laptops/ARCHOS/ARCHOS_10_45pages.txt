Let your computer acclimate itself 
Your notebook can easily stand temperature extremes but it doesn’t like rapid changes in temperature, 
like going from the cold outdoors to a warm office. Rapid changes in temperature can cause water 
droplets to condense inside your case, threatening to damage the electronic parts inside.  After receiving 
your notebook when it’s hot or cold outside, try not to power up the computer immediately; let the 
computer adjust to the room temperature gradually for at least three to four hours. 
If your computer is very cold or has been stored in a cold area, do not 
apply power to the computer until it has been allowed to come to room temperature. 
Heat, Cold, Humidity, and Glare 
Find a suitable place for your computer that’s not too hot, too cold, too dark, or too bright. Glare can make 
it hard to read the screen.   
  Allow plenty of room for air to circulate around the case to keep it from overheating. Components 
could be destroyed if they are overheated.  
  Do not block the ventilation openings.  
  Do not place your computer in direct sunlight. 
Suitable place to work 
Your computer will run well wherever you’re comfortable but extremes of temperature and humidity can 
be challenging to your system’s parts. There are some things you can tolerate that the computer can’t – 
things like static electricity, dust, water, steam and oil. In case you decide to pull over for roadside 
computing, try to choose a clean, comfortable work area for your system.

Connecting the AC Adapter 
A universal AC adapter is provided to supply your computer with power and also charge the computer’s 
battery pack. The adapter’s AC input voltage can range anywhere from 100 to 240 volts, covering the 
standard voltages available in most countries. To connect the computer to an external power source: 
 
Do not use low quality or deteriorated extension cords as this may 
result in damage to your mini PC. The computer comes with its own AC adapter. DO NOT use a 
different a adapter to power the computer. 
Never turn off or reset your notebook while the hard disk is in use 
(status icon is lit). Doing so can result in loss of data.  Always wait at least 5 seconds after turning 
off your notebook before turning it back on. Turning the power on and off in rapid succession can 
damage the notebook’s electrical circuitry.

This section contains information on the notebook’s power system, including the AC Adapter, the battery 
system, recharging the battery, and tips for conserving battery power.   
The power system is comprised of two parts, the AC Adapter and the battery system. The AC Adapter 
converts AC power from a wall outlet to the DC power required by the computer.   
The Battery Power System 
Before using the computer on battery power for the first time, check the battery status icon on the 
Windows Toolbar to make sure the battery is fully charged.  See the ‘Battery Status’ later in this section 
for a description and explanation of the Windows battery icon. Charging the battery takes about 2.5 hours 
to charge when the device is off.  If possible, always charge the battery completely. 
If you charge the battery frequently (more than 20 times 
charging/discharging in a single month), it is recommended you to perform the “Battery 
Calibration” process every 3 months to maintain the battery life.  
 
Please refer to the topic on “Battery Calibration” describing how to calibrate your system battery 
discussed on the latter part of this chapter. If you discover the battery life is getting shorter, perform the 
“Battery Calibration” process immediately.

To remove the battery pack from its compartment, refer to Chapter 3, Installing and Removing the 
Battery Pack. 
Preparing the Battery Pack for Use (Battery Calibration) 
Before using the battery pack for the first time, the Smart Battery IC within the battery pack should be 
calibrated in order to get accurate reporting of remaining battery life status.   
To calibrate the battery pack follows the instructions below: 
1.  Insert the battery into the battery compartment and turn on the notebook. If the battery is completely 
without power go to the next step. Otherwise, let the battery run down until the battery is very low 
(warning beeps are heard). The system will automatically enter Suspend mode. 
2.  Turn the notebook off. Connect the AC adapter and let the battery fully recharge. When the battery 
charge indicator turns off, the battery is fully charged. 
3.  Turn on the notebook, let the battery run down until the battery is very low (you hear the warning 
beeps).  The system will automatically enter the Suspend mode.  You can now connect the AC 
adapter. 
4.  The battery pack is now calibrated properly. 
In general, using the battery until the very low battery-warning indicator appears (or sounds) and then 
fully recharging the battery (full discharge/charge cycle) will ensure the accuracy of the battery status 
indicator. 
Automatic Battery Pack Charging Function  
To charge the battery, while the battery pack is in the notebook, plug the AC adapter into the notebook 
and an electrical outlet.  The charging time is approximately 2.5 hours when the computer is turned off 
and approximately 3.5 hours when the notebook is being used. When the battery is fully charged, the 
battery charge indicator turns off. 
If are using the computer extensively or in a high temperature environment, 
the battery may may take longer to charge fully. You need to continue to charge it with the AC 
adapter plugged in until the charging LED turns off.
 
Battery Status 
Windows Vista has an applet in the Control Panel that will display an icon in the Windows taskbar 
indicating when the notebook is running on battery power or is attached to the AC adapter.   
This applet also displays a meter that indicates how much charge is remaining in the battery.

Battery Low Warning  
When the battery initially reaches the “Battery Low” state, there are approximately 7 to 10 minutes of 
usable battery life left.  You will hear an audible beep signal every 15 seconds alerting you to the “Battery 
Low” status. When the battery power reaches the “very low” status the beeping sound will accelerate.   
Your battery will then have 1 ~ 2 minutes of battery charge remaining.  You must save your data or 
connect AC power immediately, otherwise, you may lose your data. 
 
Sound  Meaning 
Continuous 
beeping every 5 
seconds 
Battery Low: Indicates that there is 7 to 10 minutes 
charge remaining.   
Beeping 
accelerates 
Battery very low:  Indicates that there is 1 to 2 
minutes of battery charge remaining.  Save your 
work and turn off the notebook, or connect the AC 
adapter. 
 
When there is only one minute of battery charge remaining, the notebook will suspend to the HDD and 
power off.  You should connect the AC power and resume to save your work. 
 
Small Battery for the Real Time Clock 
There is a small built-in button type battery that supplies power to the system in order to maintain certain 
system information while the power is off.  If the notebook is left without a power source for a long period 
of time, this battery will be depleted and system information will be lost.   
Danger of explosion if battery is incorrectly replaced. Replace only 
with the same or equivalent type recommended by the manufacturer.  Dispose of used batteries 
according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Never remove the battery while the power is on as 
this may result in data loss when the system loses power.

After installing a software application package, you may be prompted to reset the system to load the 
changed operating environment. To reset the system, or “reboot,” press the [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Delete] keys 
simultaneously. This is known as “warm boot.” This key combination acts as a “software” reset switch 
when you encounter hardware or software problems, which lock up the notebook. If this key combination 
does not shut down the notebook, you can reset the notebook by pressing and holding the notebook’s 
power button for 5-7 seconds.

This Setup Utility is a hardware configuration program built into your computer’s BIOS (Basic Input/Output 
System). It runs and maintains a variety of hardware functions. It is menu-driven software, which allows 
you to easily configure and change the settings. Attention: You should be very careful using BIOS 
settings as you could render you computer unusable if you do not understand what you are doing. The 
BIOS allows you to set up a password to limit access to the computer (not just Windows). Unauthorized 
access to the computer can thus be prevented.

Your computer has been fully tested and complies with the system specifications before shipping. 
However, incorrect operations and/or mishandling may cause problems.This chapter provides a reference 
for identifying and correcting common hardware and software problems that you may encounter. When 
you encounter a problem, you should first try to go through the recommendations in this chapter. Instead 
of returning the computer and waiting for repair, you may easily solve the problems by considering the 
following scenarios and possible solutions. If the error continues, make sure it is related to the device 
itself and now a Windows problem before contacting ARCHOS technical support for service information. 
 
Before taking further actions, consider the following suggestions: 
  Check to see if the problem persists when all the external devices are removed. 
  Check to see that the green light indicator on the AC adapter is lit. 
  Check to see the power cord is properly plugged to the wall outlet and to the computer. 
  Check to see the power indicator of the computer is on. 
  Check to see if your keyboard is operational by pressing and holding any key. 
  Check for any incorrect or loose cable connections. Make sure the latches on the battery are 
securely in place. 
  Be sure you have not performed an incorrect setting on the hardware devices in the BIOS Setup 
utility. A faulty setting may cause the system to function incorrectly. If you are not sure of the changes 
you made, try to restore all the settings to factory defaults. 
  If you have tried to install other hardware drivers, you may have disrupted necessary system drivers. 
For example, without the audio driver properly installed, the speakers and microphone will not work. 
Connect a CD reader to reinstall the device drivers from the included CD. 
  If external devices such as a USB camera, scanner, or printer do not function correctly when 
connected to the computer, it is often an incorrect installation of the external device. Carefully check 
all the manufacturer’s documentation for the device. 
  Some software programs, which have not gone through rigorous coding and testing, may cause 
problems during use. Consult the software vendor for problem solving. 
  Some old peripherals are not plug-and-play capable. You need to restart the system with these 
devices powered up and connected first. 
  Try resetting your BIOS to factory conditions by going to BIOS SETUP and loading the  DEFAULT 
SETTING. 
  Be sure the Quick Key Lockout Switch on the bottom of the computer is not active. Otherwise the 
quick keys will not work.

  The software volume control may be turned down in Microsoft Sound System or is muted. Double-
click the speaker icon on the lower right corner of the taskbar to see if the speaker has been muted 
or turned down all the way. 
  Most audio problems are software-related. If your computer worked before, chances are an 
application has set the volume to low or off.  Double-click on the speaker icon in the system tray to 
adjust. 
  Some files that you get off the Internet have special compression systems (Codecs).  Windows does 
not automatically come with all possible codecs, and thus a music file may not play or a video file 
may have no sound.  Go to [Start > Settings > Control Panel] and double-click the Sounds and 
Audio Devices icon. In the Hardware tab, make sure that the audio codecs shown in the Properties 
of the Audio Codec include the type you are trying to play.

battery normally lasts two to five years. The battery is of type CR2032 (3V). Only allow an 
experienced technician to change this battery.

  In a 35
o
C environment, certain areas of the computer’s back could reach up to 50 degrees. 
  Make sure the computer’s ventilation grills are not blocked. 
  Certain programs that are processor-intensive may increase the computer’s temperature to a degree 
where the computer automatically slows down its CPU clock to protect itself from thermal damage.

  Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to see if an application is still responding. 
  This may be normal for Windows when it is processing other CPU-intensive programs in the 
background or when the system is accessing slow-speed devices such the floppy disk drive. 
  You may be running too many applications. Try to close some applications or increase system 
memory for better performance. 
  The processor may have been overheated due to the system’s inability to regulate its internal heat.
