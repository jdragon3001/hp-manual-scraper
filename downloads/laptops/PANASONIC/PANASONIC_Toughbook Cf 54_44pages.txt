2  Connect your computer to a power outlet
The battery charging starts automatically.
 CAUTION 
l
  Do not disconnect the AC adaptor and do not switch the 
wireless switch to on until the rst-time operation procedure 
is completed.
l
  When using the computer for the rst time, do not connect 
any peripheral device except the battery pack and AC adap-
tor.
l
  Handling the AC adaptor 
Problems such as sudden voltage drops may arise during 
periods of thunder and lightning. Since this could adversely 
affect your computer, an uninterruptible power source (UPS) 
is highly recommended unless running from the battery pack 
alone.
l
 When the DC plug is not connected to the computer, dis-
connect the AC cord from your electrical outlet. Power is 
consumed simply by having the AC adaptor plugged into an 
electrical outlet.
3  Open the display
A
  Push the top of the latch (A) to release it.
B
 Hold the side/ handle of the computer with either of your 
hands and then lift up the display to open.
 CAUTION 
l
  Do not open the display wider than necessary (180° or 
more), and do not apply excessive pressure to the LCD. Do 
not open or close the computer holding the edge of the LCD 
segment.
