Important Tips
Important Battery Tips
How to use the battery with minimal deterioration
The battery is a consumable and, as such, itsperformance will gradually deteriorate. This deterioration is accelerated under the following conditions.
When the battery is repeatedly charged
When the battery is used, charged or stored in a place with high temperature
To minimize deterioration of the battery and ensure a longer battery life, you must reduce the number of charges and ensure that the temperature inside
the battery does not become too high. Bear in mind the following points.
N O T E
n The battery pack gradually deteriorates over time even if cared following the above points. If it deteriorates, be sure to replace with a
new and specified battery pack.
n This computer reduces the full charge capacity in stages to ensure a longer life of the battery pack.
Charge the battery in a temperature range of 10 °C to 30 °C {50 °F to 86 °F}
In places where the outside air temperature ishigh, the temperature inside the battery will also become high. Do not charge the battery inside a vehicle
with all its windows closed and exposed to the hot sun or in other places where the temperature is high.
Thiscomputer's batterywillnot be charged if its temperature is outside the allowable range. (At such a time, the battery indicator blinksorange.)
We recommend charging the battery no more than once per day
Recharging the battery after every small use raises the total number of battery charges and speeds battery deterioration.
To lower the total number of battery charges, we recommend recharging the battery no more than once per day or when the remaining charge drops to
10 %or less.
With thiscomputer, in order to reduce the number of charges, the battery willnot be recharged immediately after it has been fully charged unless the
remaining charge has fallen to lessthan 95 %.
Charging the battery while the computer is powered off is recommended
If the computer's power is on, the temperature inside the battery rises due to the effectsof heat from the CPU and other components. We recommend
that you only charge the battery when the computer is powered off.
How to use the computer to maximize the battery operation time
Leave the computer off when it is not in use
Decrease the internal LCD brightness by pressing ≪Fn≫ + ≪F1≫
Pressing ≪ Fn≫ + ≪ F1≫ will lower the degree of brightness, thereby reducing the power consumption.
Before stepping away from your computer, enter the modern standby (sleep) or hibernation mode
Refer to Entering/Resuming from Sleep or Hibernation.
Click or on the task tray, and then move the “Power mode” slider ( ) to the left to set the “Power mode” to “Best
battery life”.
Thiswillreduce power consumption.
We recommend against using applications or screen saver that place a significant load on the CPU
Some screen savers place a large load on the CPU. When using these screen savers, a significant load is placed on the CPU even when the computer is
not being used. We recommend that you do not use screen saver that will drain the CPU.

--- Page 39 ---
Remove peripheral devices (USB devices, external mouse, etc.) when not in use
When the network communication is not working, turn off the wireless LAN
When the computer is not going to be used for an extended period (a month or more)
In order to maintain the battery performance, remove the battery with a remaining charge of 30 % to 40 % from the computer,
and store it in a cool, dark place
If the battery pack is kept installed in the computer, it will discharge graduallyeven when the computer's power is off. If thiscondition continues for a long
period (several months or more), the battery may overdischarge, causing itsperformance to deteriorate. In addition, this deterioration willaccelerate if
the battery pack is stored inside a vehicle with all its windows closed and exposed to the hot sun or in other places where the temperature ishigh. Store the
battery packwhere the temperature is within the range of 10 °C to 30 °C {50 °F to 86 °F}.
Things to keep in mind when using the battery pack
Bear in mind the following points when installing and removing the battery pack
Do not install or remove the battery pack while the computer is in the sleep mode.
Removal of the battery pack in this mode cause the data to be erased and cause the computer to malfunction.
Do not touch the terminals on the battery pack.
If the terminals are dirty or damaged, the battery may not function properly or the computer may not operate properly.
Charging time and discharging time differs depending on the computer's power status and temperature
It takes longer to fully charge the battery when the computer's power is on. To charge the battery more quickly, power the computer off,
or put it in the sleep or the hibernation mode.
It takes longer to fully charge the battery in low temperature environments. The battery discharges more quickly in low temperature
environments.

Cleaning the screen while the power ison may cause the computer to malfunction. Also, dirt on the screen is easier to see when the computer is
powered off, and so iseasier to clean.
Wash the soft cloth when it becomes dirty.
When the soft cloth becomes dirty, wash it with mild detergent. Do not use bleach or fabricconditioner (softener), or try to sterilize the cloth by boil-
ing.
If the soft cloth is dirty, it may be ineffective in cleaning the screen, and in fact may cause dirt to adhere to the screen.
Check the following to prevent the surface of the screen from being scratched.
Are you using your fingers or the pen (included) to operate the screen?
Is the surface clean?

--- Page 87 ---
Is the soft cloth clean?
Are your fingers clean?
Are you using the pen (included) with the tip extended?
Is the tip of the pen (included) clean?
Cleaning areas other than the LCD panel
Wipe with a soft dry cloth such as gauze. When using detergent, dip a soft cloth in water-diluted detergent and wring it thoroughly.
IMPORTANT
n Do not use benzene, thinner, or rubbing alcohol since it may adversely affect the surface causing discoloration, etc. Do not use com-
mercially available household cleaners and cosmetics, as they may contain components harmful to the surface.
n Do not apply water or detergent directly to the computer, since liquid may enter inside of the computer and cause malfunction or dam-
age.
n Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe droplets of water from the surface of the unit. Do not use a microwave to dry the unit. Doing so will result
in malfunction or damage.

<Only for model with optical disc drive>
N O T E
n Connect the AC adaptor if writing operation takes a long time. If the remaining battery power becomes low and the power is not sup-
plied, writing operation may not be completed.
n You need to use writing software to write to discs (e.g. Using Power2Go).
Ensure the disc is compatible with the selected writing speed.
You can also use Windows features to write to discs ( Using Windows Feature).
n The quality of written data depends on the disc.
Handling Precautions
Optical disc drive handling care
Do not expose the optical disc drive to excessive smoke that may leave a residue, e.g., oil smoke, or tobacco smoke. Doing so can
shorten the life of the drive lens.
We recommend cleaning the drive lens with an air puffer used for camera lenses. (Do not use any spray-type of lens cleaning
products.)
When opening/closing the tray
When the computer is on, use the eject button ( Inserting/Removing a Disc) or eject through Windows.
When inserting or removing a disc, be careful not to touch the lens and other parts of the laser pickup.
Do not leave the tray open and do not touch the lens.
The lens and disc can become dusty in some conditions. It may cause malfunction in reading or writing.
Do not apply excessive force to the tray in the open position.
Never insert a foreign object such as a paper clip into the optical disc drive.
Doing so may cause malfunction.
Do not place items other than discs on the tray.
Do not access the drive until after the tray is closed.
Set this computer on a horizontal plane.
While the optical disc drive is being accessed
Do not open the optical disc drive or move the computer while the optical disc drive is being accessed. Doing so could cause the disc
to shift position and this may damage the disc, or cause the optical disc drive to malfunction.
Do not shock the computer by removing or inserting cables and cards, etc. This may result in a read or write malfunction.
In addition, after running an application involving access to a disc, close the application before opening the optical disc drive.
Set this computer on a horizontal plane.
Disc handling care
Do not use deformed, warped, or irregularly shaped discs.
Reading of disc may not be possible depending on the disc conditions (cracks, dirt, modification, data recording quality, copy pro-
tection, recording equipment/software that was used to create the disc, etc.)
Before using a disc, carefully read the operating/handling instructions and package of the disc.
If the discs are not handled appropriately, they may become dirty or scratched. Furthermore the writing speed may get slower and the
data may not be correctly written on or read from the disc. Other damage may cause a drive failure.
Note the following precautions.
Use an appropriate discaccording to the write/rewrite speed. Checkdescriptions on the discpackage and use an appropriate disc
according to the write/rewrite speed. Some disc may not accept the specified write speed.

--- Page 89 ---
Do not touch the disc surface (the side with no printing).
<How to hold a disc>
Correct Incorrect
Keep the discsurface clean and free from dirt, dust, fingerprints and scratches.
Do not write on the surface of the disc with a ballpoint pen or other writing instrument.
Do not attach stickers to discs.
Do not drop, bend, or place heavyobjects on top of discs.
Do not place or store discs in locations exposed to heat, direct sunlight, humidity or dust.
If a disc isbrought from a cold to a warm location, condensation may form on the disc. For read-only discs, wipe off the condensation
using a soft, dry, lint-free cloth before using the disc. For recordable/rewritable discs, wait until the condensation dries.
When not using discs, keep them in their protective cases or cartridges.
To clean discs
<For read-only discs>
Wipe discs with a dry, soft cloth from the center toward the edge. If discs get very dirty, wipe with a moist, soft cloth from the center toward the
edge, then wipe again with a dry cloth to take up remaining moisture.
Correct Incorrect
<For recordable/rewritable discs>
It isrecommended to use the Panasonic disc cleaner.
Do not use a cloth.
