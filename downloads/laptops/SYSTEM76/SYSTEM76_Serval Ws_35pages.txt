performance. If you’ve purchased new RAM, need to replace your RAM, or are reseating
your RAM, follow these steps.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver

Replacing an M.2/NVMe SSD
M.2 SSDs offer, at minimum, SATA3 speeds and performance in a package about the
size of a stick of gum. NVMe M.2 SSDs offer even higher performance. The Serval WS
supports two M.2 SSDs, size 2280, either M.2 SATA or NVMe M.2 PCIe Generation 4.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the M.2 drive
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the M.2 drive (or drive slot).
3. Unscrew the retainer screw opposite the M.2 slot.
4. Remove the existing M.2 drive by sliding it sideways off the contact pins and then
lifting it out of the slot.
5. Insert the new M.2 drive into the slot, connect the contact pins, and hold it in
place.
6. Replace the retainer screw.

Replacing the CPU fan/heatsink/thermal paste
If the CPU fan becomes noisy and cleaning it out doesn’t fix the issue, you may need a
new CPU fan. Contact Support to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

In rare cases, or after several years, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste
between the CPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer
between the CPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the
unlikely event your heatsink needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 15-20 minutes
Difficulty: High
Steps to replace the CPU/GPU heatsink/thermal paste
1. Remove the bottom cover using the steps under ‘Removing the bottom cover’.
2. Unscrew the heat sink. There are 8 screws that hold the heat sink down on top of
the CPU and GPU (they are numbered), and one additional, smaller screw to align
the heat sink in the chassis.

Removing the fans for the CPU and GPU make the removal of the heat sink easier
but it is not strictly required.

Each fan is secured with 3 screws, the same size as the laptop-case screws, and
is connected to power on the board with a small cable. Remove the screws and
unplug the fans to lift them clear of the case.

3. Remove the screws, starting with 9#, then 8#, and continue until you have
removed #1.
4. Carefully remove the heatsink/fans from the case.
5. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a
small amount of rubbing alcohol to remove excess or difficult-to-remove paste.
6. After cleaning the CPU, GPU and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste
directly onto the CPU and GPU core.
7. Carefully replace the heatsink.
8. Replace the screws, starting with #1, then #2, and lastly #9. Do not fully tighten
sets #1-#4 and #5-#8 until all are in place, then fully tighten all screws for each
set (#1-#4 and #5-#8)
