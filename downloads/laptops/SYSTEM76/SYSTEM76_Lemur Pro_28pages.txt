Replacing a 2.5” SSD/HDD
2.5” drives are available as either SSD (Solid State Drive) or HDD (Hard Disk Drive.) SSDs
provide much better performance and durability compared to standard HDDs since
there are no moving parts. Standard HDDs are less expensive and are useful for storage,
however they are much more fragile.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Low
Steps to replace the M.2 drive
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the 2.5” SSD (or slot).
3. Remove the existing drive by pulling it up and away from the connector.
4. Insert the new 2.5” drive.
5. Ensure the 2.5” drive is secured in the slot and does not move.

Replacing the CPU heatsink/thermal paste
In rare cases, or after several years, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste
between the CPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer
between the CPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the
unlikely event your heatsink needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the CPU heatsink/thermal paste
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the CPU heatsink screws.
3. Remove the screws, starting with #3, then #2, and lastly #1.
4. Carefully remove the heatsink from the case.
5. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a
small amount of rubbing alcohol to remove excess or difficult-to-remove paste.
6. After cleaning the CPU and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly
onto the CPU core.
7. Carefully replace the heatsink.
8. Replace the screws, starting with #1, then #2, and lastly #3. Do not fully tighten
#1 and #2 until #3 is in place, then fully tighten all screws.

Replacing the CMOS battery
The CMOS battery supplies power to the Lemur’s CMOS chip. Changes you make to the
BIOS and the computer’s hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your clock is
constantly resetting, it’s likely your CMOS battery needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Low
Steps to replace the CMOS battery
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the CMOS battery.
3. Gently press the battery towards the CPU fan and pull up on the battery.
4. Replace the CMOS battery in the slot and press it into place.

standard M.2 2230 slot with PCIe & USB Interfaces (A Key).


Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the WiFi/Bluetooth module
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the wireless module.
3. Gently remove the two antennas by pulling them up and away from the wireless
module.
4. Remove the retaining screw opposite the M.2 slot.
5. Remove the wireless module from the slot.
6. Insert the new wireless module.
7. Replace the retaining screw.
8. Attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fitting and pressing onto the
wireless card. The connector will snap into place. Use caution when attaching
the connectors, the pins can bend, break, or snap.

BIOS utilities
When starting your Lemur, it takes a few seconds to conduct a quick check of the
components. As it proceeds, it will notify you if anything is wrong. Any issues that
prevent the system from booting will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the
Setup. If no problems are detected, your Lemur will load GRUB and then Ubuntu.

For Setup/BIOS, hold F2 while booting.
For boot options, hold F7 while booting and choose your preferred boot device.

BIOS overview
The Setup/BIOS utility allows you to make low-level changes to your Lemur. It’s not
recommended to make changes unless the settings are provided by Support, or if you
understand what you’re changing.
