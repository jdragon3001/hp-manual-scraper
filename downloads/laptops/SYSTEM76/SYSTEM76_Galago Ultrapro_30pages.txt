External displays
Aside from the standard Mini DisplayPort (MiniDP) and HDMI, the Galago also supports
MiniDP over USB-C and external GPU (eGPU) support over Thunderbolt 3.

You can switch between MiniDP or USB-C, but you cannot use both simultaneously.
To switch between MiniDP and USB-C display modes:
1. Reboot the Galago and hold the F2 key
2. At the Setup Utility, select the Advanced tab
3. Select Advanced Chipset Control
4. Change the DDI setting according to the table below

(Dependent on GPU)
Thunderbolt 3 and eGPU
Intel Thunderbolt 3 provides a direct link to the processor over PCIe 3.0 x4 at 40Gbps,
making it ideal for external GPU (eGPU) support. To use an eGPU, Thunderbolt Security
Option must be set to Legacy Mode in the BIOS.

When using an eGPU, the device must be connected prior to powering on and only
disconnected after fully powering down. eGPU devices are currently NOT hot-plug
capable. Unplugging the device will not damage the Galago or the eGPU, but the system
will not work properly until a reboot.

Replacing a 2.5” SSD/HDD
2.5” drives are available as either SSD (Solid State Drive) or HDD (Hard Disk Drive.) SSDs
provide much better performance and durability compared to standard HDDs since
there are no moving parts. Standard HDDs are less expensive and are useful for storage,
however they are much more fragile.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the 2.5” drive
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the 2.5” SSD (or slot).
3. Remove the existing drive by pulling it up and away from the connector.

Replacing the CPU heatsink/thermal paste
In rare cases, or after several years, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste
between the CPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer
between the CPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the
unlikely event your heatsink needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: High
Steps to replace the CPU heatsink/thermal paste
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the CPU heatsink screws.
3. Remove the screws, starting with #3, then #2, and lastly #1.
4. Carefully remove the heatsink from the case.
5. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a
small amount of rubbing alcohol to remove excess or difficult-to-remove paste.
6. After cleaning the CPU and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly
onto the CPU core.
7. Carefully replace the heatsink.
8. Replace the screws, starting with #1, then #2, and lastly #3. Do not fully tighten
#1 and #2 until #3 is in place, then fully tighten all screws.

Replacing the CMOS battery
The CMOS battery supplies power to the Galago’s CMOS chip. Changes you make to the
BIOS and the computer’s hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your Galago
doesn’t boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock
is constantly resetting, it’s likely your CMOS battery needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the CMOS battery
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the CMOS battery. There is a red and black wire connecting the battery to
a white connector.
3. Unplug the white connector for 1 minute, then reseat the connector.
4. Power up the Galago. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot,
this is normal.
5. Press Enter at the CMOS/BIOS reset message prompts.
6. If you are booted into the BIOS, press F4 to load defaults, then F10 to save and
resume normal boot.

standard M.2 2230 slot with PCIe & USB Interfaces (A Key).


Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the WiFi/Bluetooth module

3. Gently remove the two antennas by pulling them up and away from the wireless
module.
4. Remove the retaining screw opposite the M.2 slot.
5. Remove the wireless module from the slot.
6. Insert the new wireless module.
7. Replace the retaining screw.

BIOS utilities
When starting your Galago, it takes a few seconds to conduct a quick check of the
components. As it proceeds, it will notify you if anything is wrong. Any issues that
prevent the system from booting will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the
Setup. If no problems are detected, your Galago will load GRUB and then Ubuntu.

For Setup/BIOS, hold F2 while booting.
For boot options, hold F7 while booting and choose your preferred boot device.
Updating the BIOS
BIOS updates and instructions are sent out as needed. System76 will notify you if a
BIOS update is available for your Galago.
BIOS overview
The Setup/BIOS utility allows you to make low-level changes to your Galago. It’s not
recommended to make changes unless the settings are provided by Support, or if you
