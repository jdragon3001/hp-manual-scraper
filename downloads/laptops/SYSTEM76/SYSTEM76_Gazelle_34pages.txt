Replacing the CPU/GPU heatsink / CPU fan / thermal paste
In rare cases, or after several years, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste
between the CPU/GPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat
transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also
be used in the event your CPU fan or CPU/GPU heatsink needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: High
Steps to replace the CPU heatsink/thermal paste
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the CPU heatsink screws.

4. Carefully remove the heatsink from the case. Using a paper towel, remove the
existing thermal paste. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol to
remove excess or difficult-to-remove paste.

onto the CPU core and GPU core.

6. Carefully replace the heatsink and fan.
7. Replace the screws, starting with #1, then #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11.
Do not fully tighten until all of the screws have been started, then fully tighten all
screws.

Replacing/Resetting the CMOS battery
The CMOS battery supplies power to the Gazelle’s CMOS chip. Changes you make to
the BIOS and the computer’s hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your Gazelle
doesn’t boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock
is constantly resetting, it’s likely your CMOS battery needs replacing.

Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium

Steps to replace/restart the CMOS battery
1. Follow the steps above to remove the cover.
2. Locate the CMOS battery. There is a red and black wire connecting the battery to
a white connector.
3. Unplug the white connector for 1 minute, then reseat the connector.
4. Power up the Gazelle. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot,
this is normal.
5. Press Enter at the CMOS/BIOS reset message prompts.
6. If you are booted into the BIOS, press F4 to load defaults, then F10 to save and
resume normal boot.

BIOS utilities
When starting your Gazelle, it takes a few seconds to conduct a quick check of the
components. As it proceeds, it will notify you if anything is wrong. Any issues that
prevent the system from booting will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the
Setup. If no problems are detected, your Gazelle will load GRUB and then
Ubuntu/Pop!_OS,.

For Setup/BIOS, hold F2 while booting.
For boot options, hold F7 while booting and choose your preferred boot device.
Updating the BIOS
BIOS updates and instructions are sent out as needed. System76 will notify you if a
BIOS update is available for your Gazelle.
BIOS overview
The Setup/BIOS utility allows you to make low-level changes to your Gazelle. It’s not
recommended to make changes unless the settings are provided by Support, or if you
understand what you’re changing.
