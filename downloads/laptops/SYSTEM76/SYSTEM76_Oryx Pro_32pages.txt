Replacing the CMOS battery
The CMOS battery supplies power to the Oryx’s CMOS chip. Changes you make to the
BIOS and the computer’s hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your Oryx doesn’t
boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is
constantly resetting, it’s likely your CMOS battery needs replacing.


Time estimate: 5 minutes
Difficulty: Medium
Steps to replace the CMOS battery

a white connector.
3. Unplug the white connector for 1 minute, then reseat the connector.
4. Power up the Oryx. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot, this
is normal.
5. Press Enter at the CMOS/BIOS reset message prompts.
6. If you are booted into the BIOS, press F4 to load defaults, then F10 to save and
resume normal boot.

Replacing the WiFi/Bluetooth module
Your Oryx’s WiFi and Bluetooth are both handled with the same module. It is a standard
M.2 2230 slot with PCIe & USB Interfaces (A Key).


Tools required: Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver
Time estimate: 5 minutes

BIOS utilities
When starting your Oryx, it takes a few seconds to conduct a quick check of the
components. As it proceeds, it will notify you if anything is wrong. Any issues that
prevent the system from booting will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the
Setup. If no problems are detected, your Oryx will load GRUB and then Ubuntu/Pop!_OS,.

For Setup/BIOS, hold F2 while booting.
For boot options, hold F7 while booting and choose your preferred boot device.
Updating the BIOS
BIOS updates and instructions are sent out as needed. System76 will notify you if a
BIOS update is available for your Oryx.
BIOS overview
The Setup/BIOS utility allows you to make low-level changes to your Oryx. It’s not
recommended to make changes unless the settings are provided by Support, or if you
understand what you’re changing.
