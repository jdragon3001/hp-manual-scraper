power and also charge the computer’s battery pack. The adapter’s 
AC input voltage can range anywhere from 100 to 240 volts, 
covering the standard voltages available in almost every country. 
To connect the computer to an external power source: 
 
Do not use inferior extension 
cords as this may result in damage to your Intel-powered 
classmate PC.  
Second generation Intel-powered classmate PC refresh 
comes with its own AC adapter. Do not use a different adapter 
to power the computer and  other electrical devices. 
Whenever possible, keep the AC adapter plugged into the Intel-
powered classmate PC and an electrical outlet to recharge the 
battery.

--- Page 26 ---
20 
Never turn off or reset your Intel-
powered classmate PC while the hard disk is in use; doing so 
can result in loss or destruction of your data.  Always wait at 
least 5 seconds after turning off your Intel-powered classmate 
PC before turning it back on; turning the power on and off in 
rapid succession can damage the Intel-powered classmate 
PC’s electrical circuitry.

Turn on your Intel-powered classmate PC by pressing the power 
button. Hold the button down for a second or two and release. The 
Power-On Self Test (POST) runs automatically.   
After the POST is completed, the computer reads the operating 
system from the hard disk drive into computer memory (this is 
commonly referred to as “booting” a computer). If your OS 
(Operating System such as Windows Vista…. etc)  is installed, it 
should start automatically. 
To turn the Intel-powered classmate PC off, save your work and 
close all open applications, click on Start, then Shu
t Down and 
select Shut down the computer and click "Y
es" or press the 
power button for 4-6 seconds.

Your computer comes with a rechargeable battery pack that lets 
you operate the computer without an external power source.  
When the battery pack is fully charged, you can operate the 
computer under the following conditions:  
¾  The battery pack initially has a full charge. 
¾  No peripheral devices are installed. 
Danger of explosion if battery is 
incorrectly replaced. Replace only with same or equivalent 
type recommended by the manufacturer. Discard used 
batteries according to the manufacturer’s instructions or local 
laws.

To Install the Battery Pack:

--- Page 28 ---
22 
To Remove the Battery Pack: 
 
Lithium-Ion Battery 
Your Intel-powered classmate PC uses a Lithium-Ion battery pack 
that provides power when you don’t have access to an AC outlet. 
You must charge the battery pack for at 
least six hours before using it for the first time. 
In the Standby Suspend mode, a fully charged battery loses 
its power in roughly 1/2 day or less.

--- Page 29 ---
23 
When not being used, the battery’s power will deplete in one 
to two months.  
The battery pack in this system is replaceable by the end 
user. 
Battery Low-Power Warning 
1.   Low Battery Warning 
Low battery condition occurs when battery power is reduced to 10 
percent. The orange battery status LED indicator blinks and the 
system beeps once every 16 seconds or so. 
2.   Very Low Battery Warning 
Very Low battery condition occurs at 5 percent power remaining. 
The orange battery status LED indicator blinks and the system 
beeps at 4-second interval.   
When the Intel-powered classmate PC warns you of its low battery 
condition, you will have about three to five minutes to save your 
current work. 
Do not expose battery packs to 
temperatures below 0 degree Celsius (32 degree F) or above 
60 degree C (140 degree F). This may adversely affect the 
battery pack.  
Charging the Battery and Charging Time 
To charge the battery, plug the AC adapter into the Intel-powered 
classmate PC and an electrical outlet. 
For a totally discharged battery, it will take approximately two hours 
to charge to 90% capacity, and approximately three hours to 100% 
capacity while Intel-powered classmate PC is powered off. It will 
take about 5 hrs to charge the battery to 100% capacity while Intel-
powered classmate PC is powered on. 
When the battery is fully charged, the battery charge indicator 
becomes green. 
If system runs at heavy loads or in a high 
temperature environment, the battery may not be fully 
charged. You need to continue to charge it with the AC 
adapter plugged in until the charging LED turns green.

--- Page 30 ---
24 
System will not charge battery when 
temperature exceeds 40C. 
Checking the Battery Level 
You can check the remaining battery power in Operating System 
battery status indicator.  
Prolonging the Battery’s Life and Usage Cycles 
There are ways you can prolong the use of battery. 
¾  Use the AC adapter wherever AC wall outlet is available. This 
will ensure uninterrupted computing. 
¾  Store the battery pack in room temperature. Higher 
temperature tends to deplete the battery’s power faster. 
¾  Make good use of the power management function. Save To 
Disk (Hibernate) saves the most energy by storing current 
system contents in a hard disk space reserved for this 
function. 
¾  The life expectancy of the battery is approximately 300 
recharges. 
¾  See the notices section in the beginning of the user manual 
on how to care for the battery pack. 
¾  Use Function+F9 key to decrease the brightness of the 
screen. 
To achieve optimal battery performance, 
you may need to do a battery calibration at a 3-month interval. 
To do this: 
¾  Fully charge the battery. 
¾  Then discharge the battery by entering the BIOS setup screen. 
(Press DEL key as soon as you turn on the computer. And let 
it remain at the setup screen until the battery runs out. 
¾  Fully charge the battery again.

Standby Suspend 
The system automatically enters this mode after a period of 
inactivity, which is set in the Power Schemes dialog box. In 
Standby mode, hardware devices, such as display panel and hard 
disk, are turned off to conserve energy. 
Hibernate Suspend 
In this mode, all system data are saved in the hard disk before 
powering down. When this mode is activated, all system state and 
contents are saved to the hard disk drive after a period of inactivity 
defined by the user.  
No power or very little power is drawn from the battery module 
under this mode.  
However, depending on how much RAM that has been installed on 
your computer, the amount of time the system requires to restore 
all its previous contents can range from five to 20 seconds.

The Setup Utility is a hardware configuration program built into 
your computer’s BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). It runs and 
maintains a variety of hardware functions. It is menu-driven 
software, which allows you to easily configure and change the 
settings. 
The BIOS contains manufacture’s default settings for the 
computer’s standard operations. However, there are occasions 
when you may be required to modify the default settings in the 
BIOS.  
The BIOS allows you to set up passwords to limit access to users. 
This is an important feature because a great deal of vital 
information is carried within the computer nowadays. Unauthorized 
access can be prevented. Later in this chapter, you will learn how 
to use this security feature.

The passwords activate two different levels of protection: 
1.  System always asks for password every time it is powered on.  
2.  System asks for password only when you attempt to enter 
BIOS utility. 
The passwords are encrypted and stored in NVRAM. Make sure 
you write them down or memorize them. If you loose the 
passwords, the computer may need to be sent back to the factory 
or to an authorized service dealer to reset the passwords.

¾  Check to see the power indicator of the computer is on. 
¾  Check to see if your keyboard is operational by pressing and 
holding any key. 
¾  Check for any incorrect or loose cable connections. Make 
sure the latches on the connectors latch securely on to the 
receptor end.

defaults. 
¾  Be sure all the device drivers are installed properly. For 
example, without the audio driver properly installed, the 
speakers and microphone will not work. 
¾  If external devices such as USB camera, scanner or printer 
do not function correctly when connected to the system, it is 
usually the device’s own problem. Consult the device’s 
manufacturer first. 
¾  Some software programs, which have not gone through 
rigorous coding and testing, may cause problems during your 
routine use. Consult the software vendor for problem solving. 
¾  Be sure to go to BIOS SETUP and load DEFAULT SETTING 
after BIOS re-flash.

The hard disk drive does not work or is not recognizable: 
¾  If you had just performed a hard disk upgrade, make sure the 
hard drive connector is not loose and the hard disk drive is 
also correctly seated. Remove it and reinsert it firmly, and 
restart your PC. (Refer to Chapter 5 for details.) 
¾  The new HDD may need to be partitioned and reformatted. 
O/S and drivers will need to be re-installed as well.

¾  Check the hard disk indicator LED. When you access a file, 
the LED lamp should light up momentarily. 
¾  The new HDD may be defective or is not compatible. 
¾  If your computer has been subjected to static electricity or 
physical shock, you may have damaged the disk drive. 
The hard drive is making abnormal whining noises 
¾  You should back up your files as soon as possible. 
¾  Make sure the source of noise is indeed from the hard drive 
and not the fan or other devices. 
The hard disk drive has reached its capacity 
¾  Archive files or programs that you had no longer used by 
moving them to an alternative storage medium (card reader, 
etc.) or uninstall programs that are no longer used. 
¾  Many browsers store files in the hard drive as a cache to 
speed up the performance. Check the program’s Online Help 
for instructions on decreasing the cache size or on removing 
temporary Internet files. 
The hard disk takes longer to read a file 
¾  Interrupt requests or problems with other hardware devices 
may have occupied the CPU and therefore slows down the 
system performance.

The computer becomes hot 
¾  In a 35
o
C environment, the certain areas of the computer’s 
back case are expected to reach 50 degrees. 
¾  Make sure the air vents are not blocked. 
¾  If the fan does not seem to be working at high temperature 
(50 degrees Celsius and up), contact the service center. 
¾  Certain programs that are processor-intensive may increase 
the computer temperature to a degree where the computer 
automatically slows down its CPU clock to protect itself from 
heat damage. 
The program appears stopped or runs very slowly 
¾  Restart the computer. 
¾  This may be normal for Operating System when it is 
processing other CPU-intensive programs in the background 
or when the system is accessing slow-speed devices such the 
floppy disk drive. 
¾  You may be running too many applications. Try to close some 
applications or increase system memory for higher 
performance. 
¾  The processor may have been overheated due to the 
system’s inability to regulate its internal temperature. Make 
sure the computer’s ventilation grills are not blocked.
