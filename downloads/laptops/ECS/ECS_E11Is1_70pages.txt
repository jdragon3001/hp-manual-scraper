Connecting the AC Adapter 
A universal AC adapter is provided to supply your computer with 
power and also charge the computer’s battery pack. The adapter’s 
AC input voltage can range anywhere from 100 to 240 volts, 
covering the standard voltages available in almost every country. 
To connect the computer to an external power source: 
 
Do not use inferior extension 
cords as this may result in damage to your Intel-powered 
classmate PC. Intel-powered clamshell Classmate PC comes 
with its own AC adapter. Do not use a different adapter to 
power the computer and  other electrical devices. 
Whenever possible, keep the AC adapter plugged into the Intel-
powered classmate PC and an electrical outlet to recharge the 
battery.

--- Page 27 ---
22 
Never turn off or reset your Intel-
powered classmate PC while the hard disk is in use; doing so 
can result in loss or destruction of your data.  Always wait at 
least 5 seconds after turning off your Intel-powered classmate 
PC before turning it back on; turning the power on and off in 
rapid succession can damage the Intel-powered classmate 
PC’s electrical circuitry.

Your Intel-powered classmate PC uses a Lithium-Ion battery pack 
that provides power when you don’t have access to an AC outlet.

--- Page 30 ---
25 
You must charge the battery pack for at 
least six hours before using it for the first time. 
In the Standby Suspend mode, a fully charged battery loses 
its power in roughly 1/2 day or less.  
When not being used, the battery’s power will deplete in one 
to two months.  
The battery pack in this system is replaceable by the end 
user. 
Battery Low-Power Warning 
1.   Low Battery Warning 
Low battery condition occurs when battery power is reduced to 10 
percent. The red battery status LED indicator blinks and the 
system beeps once every 16 seconds or so. 
2.   Very Low Battery Warning 
Very Low battery condition occurs at 5 percent power remaining. 
The red battery status LED indicator blinks and the system beeps 
at 4-second interval.   
When the Intel-powered classmate PC warns you of its low battery 
condition, you will have about three to five minutes to save your 
current work. 
Do not expose battery packs to 
temperatures below 0 degree Celsius (32 degree F) or above 
60 degree C (140 degree F). This may adversely affect the 
battery pack.  
Charging the Battery and Charging Time 
To charge the battery, plug the AC adapter into the Intel-powered 
classmate PC and an electrical outlet. 
For a totally discharged battery, it will take approximately two hours 
to charge to 90% capacity, and approximately three hours to 100% 
capacity while Intel-powered classmate PC is powered off. It will 
take about 5 hrs to charge the battery to 100% capacity while Intel-
powered classmate PC is powered on.

--- Page 31 ---
26 
When the battery is fully charged, the battery charge indicator 
becomes blue. 
If system runs at heavy loads or in a high 
temperature environment, the battery may not be fully 
charged. You need to continue to charge it with the AC 
adapter plugged in until the charging LED turns blue. 
System will not charge battery when 
temperature exceeds 45C.
 
Checking the Battery Level 
You can check the remaining battery power in Operating System 
battery status indicator.  
Prolonging the Battery’s Life and Usage Cycles 
There are ways you can prolong the use of battery. 
  Use the AC adapter wherever AC wall outlet is available. This 
will ensure uninterrupted computing. 
  Store the battery pack in room temperature. Higher 
temperature tends to deplete the battery’s power faster. 
  Make good use of the power management function. Save To 
Disk (Hibernate) saves the most energy by storing current 
system contents in a hard disk space reserved for this 
function. 
  The life expectancy of the battery is approximately 300 
recharges. 
  See the notices section in the beginning of the user manual 
on how to care for the battery pack. 
  Use Function+F7 key to decrease the brightness of the 
screen. 
To achieve optimal battery performance, 
you may need to do a battery calibration at a 3-month interval. 
To do this:

--- Page 32 ---
27 
  Fully charge the battery. 
  Then discharge the battery by entering the BIOS setup screen. 
(Press DEL key as soon as you turn on the computer. And let 
it remain at the setup screen until the battery runs out. 
  Fully charge the battery again.

Standby Suspend 
The system automatically enters this mode after a period of 
inactivity, which is set in the Power Schemes dialog box. In 
Standby mode, hardware devices, such as display panel and hard 
disk, are turned off to conserve energy. 
Hibernate Suspend 
In this mode, all system data are saved in the hard disk before 
powering down. When this mode is activated, all system state and 
contents are saved to the hard disk drive after a period of inactivity 
defined by the user.  
No power or very little power is drawn from the battery module 
under this mode.  
However, depending on how much RAM that has been installed on 
your computer, the amount of time the system requires to restore 
all its previous contents can range from five to 20 seconds.

The Hard-Disk Drive (HDD) Protection application protects the 
notebook HDD from damage caused by sudden harmful notebook 
shocks.   
It monitors system movements that exceed the defined shock 
threshold. Once a shock is detected, the application instructs the 
HDD to temporarily park it’s heads which protects against 
potential damage the drive. When the notebook motion stabilizes 
the heads are then un-parked.

The Setup Utility is a hardware configuration program built into 
your computer’s BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). It runs and 
maintains a variety of hardware functions. It is menu-driven 
software, which allows you to easily configure and change the 
settings. 
The BIOS contains manufacture’s default settings for the 
computer’s standard operations. However, there are occasions 
when you may be required to modify the default settings in the 
BIOS.  
The BIOS allows you to set up passwords to limit access to users. 
This is an important feature because a great deal of vital 
information is carried within the computer nowadays. Unauthorized 
access can be prevented. Later in this chapter, you will learn how 
to use this security feature.

Your computer has been fully tested and complies with the system 
specifications before shipping. However, incorrect operations 
and/or mishandling may cause problems. You may also encounter 
simple setup or operating problems that can solve by considering 
the following suggestions. If the problem persists, contact your 
dealer for service. 
  Check to see if the power cord is properly plugged into the 
wall outlet and to the computer. 
  Check to see the power indicator of the computer is on. 
  Check to see if your keyboard is operational by pressing and 
holding any key. 
  Check for any incorrect or loose cable connections. Make 
sure the latches on the connectors latch securely on to the 
receptor end. 
  Be sure you have not performed an incorrect setting on the 
hardware devices in the BIOS Setup utility. A faulty setting 
may cause the system to malfunction. If you are not sure of 
the changes you made, try to restore all the settings to factory 
defaults. 
  Be sure all the device drivers are installed properly. For 
example, without the audio driver properly installed, the 
speakers and microphone will not work. 
  Some software programs, which have not gone through 
rigorous coding and testing, may cause problems during your 
routine use. Consult the software vendor for problem solving.
