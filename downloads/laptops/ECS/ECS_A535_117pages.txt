Your Mobile PC can easily stand temperature extremes but it doesn’t like rapid changes in 
temperature, like going from the cold outdoors to a warm office.  Rapid changes in 
temperature can cause water droplets to condense inside your case, threatening to 
damage the electronic parts inside. 
After receiving your Mobile PC when it’s hot or cold outside, try not to power up the 
computer immediately, let the computer adjust to the room temperature gradually at least 
for three to four hours 
  If your system arrives in cold weather, do not apply power to the 
computer or monitor until they have been allowed to come to room temperature

Find a suitable place for your computer that’s not too hot, too cold, too dark, or too bright.  
Glare can make it hard to read the screen. 
•  Try to avoid the computer components from being destroyed if it is over heated, so 
try to allow plenty of room for air to circulate around the case. 
•  Do not block the ventilation opening. 
•  Do not place your computer in direct sunlight.

A universal AC adapter is 
provided to supply your computer 
with power and also charge the 
computer’s battery pack.   
The adapter’s AC input voltage 
can range anywhere from 100 to 
240 volts, covering the standard 
voltages available in almost every 
country.  
The power cord for the AC 
adapter requires a three-hole 
grounded AC outlet.  To connect 
the computer to an external power 
source: 
 
Plug the AC adapter’s connector into the DC-IN connector on the rear of the computer.

.
.
 
 
Connect the power cord to the AC adapter and then to a wall outlet. 
  The best kind of AC power source to connect your Mobile PC   
to is a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply).  Lacking this, use a power strip with a 
built-in surge protector.  Do not use inferior extension cords as this may result in 
damage to your Mobile PC  .  The Mobile PC   comes with its own AC adapter. Do 
not use a different adapter to power the computer and  other electrical devices. 
- 25 -

--- Page 28 ---
Whenever possible, keep the AC adapter plugged into the Mobile PC and an electrical 
outlet to recharge the battery.  
  Never turn off or reset your Mobile PC   while the hard disk is 
in use and the HDD status icon is lit; doing so can result in loss or destruction of 
your data.  Always wait at least 5 seconds after turning off your Mobile PC   before 
turning it back on; turning the power on and off in rapid succession can damage 
the Mobile PC  ’s electrical circuitry.

Turn on your Mobile PC by pressing the power button.  Hold the button down for a second 
or two and release.  The Power-On Self Test (POST) runs automatically.   
After the POST is completed, the computer reads the operating system from the hard disk 
drive into computer memory (this is commonly referred to as “booting” a computer).  If your 
OS (Operating System such as Windows ME, Windows 2000…. etc)  is installed, it should 
start automatically. 
To turn the Mobile PC off, save your work and close all open applications, click on Start, 
then Shu
t Down and select Shut down the computer and click "Yes" or press the power 
button for 4-6 seconds.

The system provides you with a removable battery pack that 
does not provides the computer with information about its power status. 
Your computer comes with a rechargeable removable battery pack that lets you operate 
the computer without an external power source.  When the removable battery pack is fully 
charged, you can operate the computer for approximately 1.5 hours under the following 
conditions:  
•  The removable battery pack initially has a full charge. 
•  No peripheral devices are installed. 
•  The disk/CD-ROM drives run no more than 10% of the time. 
•  The battery pack is 8-cell battery pack. 
•  Power Now is enabled.  
  Only use batteries that are approved by an authorized 
dealer.  All batteries are not the same and therefore should not be treated as 
such.  Using the wrong battery could cause serious damage to your computer and 
yourself through toxic emissions.

The Mobile PC  ’s keyboard uses a standard QWERTY layout with the addition of special 
function keys and an embedded numeric keypad for number intensive data entry.  Your 
keyboard supports Windows  by incorporating the two Windows specific keys.  With the 
two Windows keys you will be able to access and take advantage of many of the 
timesaving features of Windows software. 
The function keys (F1-F12) on the top row of the keyboard, serve different purposes and 
carry out different tasks depending on the application you are running.   
The cursor (arrow) keys (which are all located in the lower right corner of your keyboard) 
and the [PgUp], [PgDn], [Home] and [End] keys (which are located along the right edge of 
the keyboard) allow you to move the active cursor of the computer to various locations on 
the screen or within the document. 
The embedded numeric keypad consists of 15 keys that make number intensive input 
more convenient.  Like the [Num Lock] key, these keys are labeled in blue on the keycaps.  
Numeric assignments are located at the upper right of each key.   
- 33 -

--- Page 36 ---
When the numeric keypad is engaged, the NumLock icon will appear in the System 
Window.  The keypad is activated by pressing the [Fn] + [NumLk] key.  If an external 
keyboard is connected, pressing the NumLock key on either the Mobile PC or external 
keyboard will enable/disable NumLock of both keyboards in unison. 
To disable the Mobile PC numeric keypad while keeping the keypad on an external 
keyboard activated, use the [Fn] + [NumLk] hot key on the Mobile PC   keyboard.

There is a small built-in battery pack that supplies power to the system in order to maintain 
certain system information while the power is off.  If the Mobile PC is left without a power 
source for long period of time, this battery will be exhausted and system information will be 
lost.   
  Danger of explosion if battery is incorrectly replaced.  Replace only 
with the same or equivalent type recommended by the manufacturer.  Dispose of 
used batteries according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Never remove the 
battery pack while the power is on as this may result in data loss when the system 
loses power.

Problems with your computer can be caused by something as minor as an 
unplugged power cord – or as major as a damaged hard disk. The information in 
this chapter is designed to help you find and solve minor problems. If you try all 
the suggested solutions and you still have a problem, make a list of what steps 
you have taken to correct the problem and contact your dealer.  
Successful troubleshooting is the result of careful observation, deductive 
reasoning, and an organized approach to solving the problem.  
The problems that you will encounter can be divided into two basic categories: 
hardware problems and software problems. Hardware problems can be further 
divided into electrical and mechanical problems. You will know you have a 
hardware problem if the screen is dark, the computer cannot read the disk drives, 
or you get an error message during the Power-On Self Test (POST). 
Software errors can occur at several levels.  The ROM BIOS and the operating 
system can give you a large number of error messages.  On top of this, each 
application software package has its own set of error messages. It is important to 
determine whether the software error message you are getting is from the 
application or the operating system. Once you know this, you can look in the 
respective manual for a solution to the problem.

Start by performing a careful visual inspection of the exterior of the computer.  If 
no LEDs are illuminated, make sure that your computer and its peripherals are 
getting power and communicating with each other properly. 
To check the power cables, and connections:

If you have been using battery power, connect the Mobile PC   to an external 
power source and make sure that the battery has a charge.

If you are using the Mobile PC   with the AC adapter, check the power outlet, 
the power cord, and any power switches that may affect your computer. 
•  Check the wall outlet or power strip with an item that you know is 
functioning properly. A lamp or radio is a convenient item for checking the 
power. You may also need to check the fuses and breakers in your electric 
box. 
•  If the outlet is controlled by a wall switch, make sure that the switch is on. 
•  If the outlet is controlled by a dimmer switch, use a different outlet. 
•  If your computer is plugged into a power strip with an On/Off switch, make 
sure the switch is on. 
With the computer’s power switched off, check all cable connections. If the 
computer is connected to any peripheral devices, look for loose or 
disconnected cables.  
If the computer is too close to a wall, a cable connection may be loose or the 
cables may be crimped.  
 Do not substitute cables for different devices (other than the 
manufacturer recommended cables) even if they look exactly alike. The 
wiring inside the cable may be different.

When you are certain that you have power available and all connections are 
good, turn the computer on again. If the computer still does not start, you may 
have a hardware problem.

The Power-On Self Test (POST) runs every time you turn on or reset the Mobile 
PC. The POST checks memory, the main system board, the display, the keyboard, 
the disk drives, and other installed options.  
A few seconds after you turn on your computer, a copyright message appears on 
your display screen. A memory test message appears next; as the test continues, 
memory size increases until all installed memory is tested. Normally, the only test 
routine visible on the screen will be the memory test. 
Two classifications of malfunctions can be detected during the POST: 
•  Error messages that indicate a failure with either the hardware, the 
software, or the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). These critical 
malfunctions prevent the computer from operating at all or could cause 
incorrect and apparent results. An example of a critical error is 
microprocessor malfunction. 
•  Messages that furnish important information on the power-on and boot 
processes (such as memory status). These non-critical malfunctions are 
those that cause incorrect results that may not be readily apparent. An 
example of a non-critical error would be a memory chip failure. 
In general, if the POST detects a system board failure (a critical error), the 
computer halts and generates a series of beeps. If failure is detected in an area 
other than the system board (such as the display, keyboard, or an adapter card) 
an error message is displayed on the screen and testing is stopped. It is important 
to remember that the POST does not test all areas of the computer, only those 
that allow it to be operational enough to run diagnostic programs.  
If your system does not successfully complete the POST, but displays a blank 
screen, emits a series of beeps, or displays an error code, consult your dealer.

•  Check the cable connection. 
•  Check the mouse with another application to see if there is a 
software incompatibility problem. 
•  If possible, check the mouse with another computer to see if it 
works.  If it doesn’t operate on a different system, the mouse might 
be broken.

If you still have a problem after reading the preceding sections, the next step is to 
contact your dealer.  Your dealer can determine if the problem is something that 
requires the computer to be taken to the shop. Before you call your dealer, 
however, prepare the following information: 
•  How is your computer configured? Your dealer needs to know what 
peripheral devices you are using. 
•  What messages, if any, are on the screen? 
•  What software were you running at the time? 
•  What have you done already to try to solve the problem? If you have 
overlooked a step, your dealer may be able to solve the problem over the 
phone.

If you need to install a higher capacity module, gently push the edge clips on 
both sides to release the module.  Angle the card slightly upward and gently 
slide it from its edge connector slot.  Store the card in the anti-static bag that 
contains your new module(s). 
To install the new memory card, hold the card with its gold edge connector 
toward the edge connector slot of the compartment.  To help you orient the 
cards, the edge connector has been made with two unequal-length sections.  
You will only be able to insert the card in one direction. 
Insert the edge connector into the slot.  The gold edge connector of the card 
should not be visible when the card is fully inserted. 
Press the card downward where you should hear an audible click as the 
latches of the connector secure the card in place. 
Once the module is properly seated, you can replace the cover on this 
compartment.  
Replace and tighten the screw.
