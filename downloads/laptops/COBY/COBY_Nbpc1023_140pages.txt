Pesquisa de defeitos
Problema Solução
Bateria 
Seu computador desliga antes 
do indicador de status da 
bateria acender, ou continua 
funcionando depois que ele 
acende.
Remova e reinsira a bateria. Se o problema persistir, pode 
ser necessário substituir a bateria.
O tempo de funcionamento de 
uma bateria completamente 
carregada é curto, ou o com-
putador não funciona com 
uma bateria completamente 
carregada.
Remova e reinsira a bateria. Se o problema persistir, pode 
ser necessário substituir a bateria.
O protetor de surto de tensão na bateria pode estar ativo. 
Desligue o computador durante 1 minuto para redenir o 
protetor; em seguida, ligue-o novamente.
A bateria não carrega. Substitua a bateria.
Disco rígido
A unidade de disco rígido não 
funciona.
No menu Inicializar do Utilitário de conguração do AMI, 
veja se o disco está incluído na Sequência de inicialização.
Outros problemas
O computador não responde.  Desligue o computador pressionando e segurando o botão 
Ligar/desligar por 4 segundos ou mais. Se o computador 
não responder, remova o adaptador de CA e a bateria.
Seu computador pode travar se entrar no modo de hiberna-
ção durante uma operação de comunicação. Para impedir 
isto, desative o cronômetro de hibernação quando estiver 
trabalhando na internet ou na rede.
Para sua segurança, nunca tente consertar o dispositivo sozinho. Isto 
anula a garantia. Os componentes internos do dispositivo apresentam 
risco de choque elétrico.
