Media Base Setup Guide 5
CAUTION: Safety Instructions
Use the following safety guidelines to help ensure your own personal safety and to help protect your device (computer, port 
replicator, media base, docking station, and similar devices) and working environment from potential damage.
SAFETY: General Safety
Observe the following safe-handling guidelines to ensure personal safety:
• When setting up the device for work, place it on a level surface.
• Do not attempt to service the device yourself, except as explained in your Dell™ documentation or in instructions otherwise 
provided to you by Dell. Always follow installation and service instructions closely.
• To help avoid the potential hazard of electric shock, do not connect or disconnect any cables or perform maintenance or 
reconfiguration of this product during an electrical storm. Do not use your media base during an electrical storm unless all 
cables have been disconnected and the computer is operating on battery power.
• If your device includes an integrated or optional (PC Card) modem, disconnect the modem cable if an electrical storm is 
approaching to avoid the remote risk of electric shock from lightning via the telephone line.
• Do not push any objects into air vents or openings of your device. Doing so can cause fire or electric shock by shorting out 
interior components.
• Keep your device away from radiators and heat sources. Also, do not block cooling vents. Avoid placing loose papers 
underneath your device; do not place your device in a closed-in wall unit or on a bed, sofa, or rug.
• Do not use your device in a wet environment, for example, near a bath tub, sink, or swimming pool or in a wet basement.
• Do not spill food or liquids on your computer.
• Before you clean your device, disconnect the device from the electrical outlet. Clean your device with a soft cloth dampened 
with water. Do not use liquid or aerosol cleaners, which may contain flammable substances.
• Ensure that nothing rests on your AC adapter’s power cable and that the cable is not located where it can be tripped over or 
stepped on.
• Do not store your computer in a low-airflow environment, such as a carrying case or a closed briefcase, while the computer is 
turned on. Restricting airflow can damage the computer or cause a fire. 
• Do not allow your portable computer to operate with the base resting directly on exposed skin for extended periods of time. 
The surface temperature of the base will rise during normal operation (particularly when AC power is present). Allowing 
sustained contact with exposed skin can cause discomfort or, eventually, a burn.
• PC Cards may become very warm during normal operation. Use care when removing PC Cards after their continuous 
operation. 
• This device may contain Optical Disk Drives (ODD), CD-ROM, CDR/W, DVD, etc., which have built-in laser devices. 
These ODDs comply with safety requirements and are classified as "Class 1 Laser Products," under US DHHS Standard and 
EN/IEC60825-1 Laser Safety Standard. These ODDs contain no user adjustments or serviceable or replaceable parts. To 
prevent any risk of exposure to laser radiation, do not disable or open ODD assembly for any reason.
WARNING: 
The cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other 
reproductive harm. 
Wash hands after handling.

SAFETY: Power Safety
• If this product is provided with a 3-prong power cable, be sure to plug it into a properly grounded power source in order to 
help prevent electric shock. Do not use adapter plugs or remove the grounding prong from the power cable plug. If you use a 
power extension cable, use the appropriate type to mate with the adapter power cable plug. 
• If you use an extension power cable with your AC adapter, ensure that the total ampere rating of the products plugged in to 
the extension power cable does not exceed the ampere rating of the extension cable.
• Use only the Dell-provided AC adapter approved for use with this device. Use of another AC adapter may cause a fire or 
explosion. See your User’s Guide or Owner’s Manual for AC adapter electrical ratings. 
• If you are using a multiple-outlet power strip, use caution when plugging the AC adapter’s power cable into the power strip. 
Some power strips may allow you to insert the plug incorrectly. Incorrect insertion of the power plug could result in 
permanent damage to your device, as well as risk of electric shock and/or fire. Ensure that the ground prong of the power 
plug is inserted into the mating ground contact of the power strip.
• Before you connect the device to an electrical outlet, check the AC adapter voltage rating to ensure that the required voltage 
and frequency match the available power source. 
• To remove the computer from all power sources, turn the computer off, disconnect the AC adapter from the electrical 
outlet, and remove any battery installed in the battery bay or module bay. 
• Place the AC adapter in a ventilated area, such as a desk top or on the floor, when you use it to run the computer or to charge 
the battery. Do not cover the AC adapter with papers or other items that will reduce cooling; also, do not use the AC adapter 
inside a carrying case. 
• The AC adapter may become hot during normal operation of your computer. Use care when handling the adapter during or 
immediately after operation. 
• Norway and Sweden: Connect the power cable to a grounded electrical outlet only. 
• Japan Only: Use only the Dell-provided AC power cable with the AC adapter. Use of any other power cable may damage the 
device or AC adapter or may present risk of fire or electric shock.
Equipment Protection Instructions
Observe the following safe-handling guidelines to prevent damage to your equipment:
  NOTICE: When taking the computer from low-temperature conditions into a warmer environment or from high-temperature 
conditions into a cooler environment, allow the computer to acclimate to room temperature and for any condensation that may 
have formed to evaporate before turning on power to avoid damage to the computer. 
• Protect your device from environmental hazards such as dirt, dust, food, liquids, temperature extremes, and overexposure to 
sunlight.
• Keep the device away from direct or excessive moisture and extremely hot or cold temperatures to ensure that the computer 
is used within the specified operating range. 
• Leave a 10.2 cm (4 in) minimum clearance on all vented sides of the device to permit the airflow required for proper 
ventilation. 
• Do not restrict airflow into the device by blocking any vents or air intakes. 
  CAUTION: When preparing your AC adapter for travel, wrap both of the cords around the adapter in the same direction as 
shown in the following picture. Failure to wrap the cords in the correct direction can result in damage to the cords not covered 
by the adapter warranty. Never use an AC adapter that shows signs of damage or excessive wear.

Media Base Setup Guide 7
Protecting Against Electrostatic Discharge
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) events can harm electronic components inside your computer. Under certain conditions, ESD may 
build up on your body or an object, such as a peripheral, and then discharge into another object, such as your computer. To prevent 
ESD damage, you should discharge static electricity from your body before you interact with any of your computer’s internal 
electronic components, such as a memory module. You can protect against ESD by touching a metal grounded object (such as an 
unpainted metal surface on your computer’s I/O panel) before you interact with anything electronic. When connecting a 
peripheral (including handheld digital assistants) to your computer, you should always ground both yourself and the peripheral 
before connecting it to the computer. In addition, as you work inside the computer, periodically touch an I/O connector to remove 
any static charge your body may have accumulated.
You can also take the following steps to prevent damage from electrostatic discharge:
• When unpacking a static-sensitive component from its shipping carton, do not remove the component from the antistatic 
packing material until you are ready to install the component. Just before unwrapping the antistatic package, be sure to 
discharge static electricity from your body.
• When transporting a sensitive component, first place it in an antistatic container or packaging.
• Handle all electrostatic sensitive components in a static-safe area. If possible, use antistatic floor pads and work bench pads.

VÝSTRAHA: Bezpečnostní pokyny
Dodržováním následujících bezpečnostních pokynů přispějete k zajištění své vlastní bezpečnosti i k ochraně svého zařízení (počítače, 
replikátoru portů, základny médií, dokovací stanice a dalších) a pracovního prostředí před možným poškozením.
BEZPEČNOSTNÍ POKYNY: Obecná bezpečnost
K zajištění osobní bezpečnosti se řiďte následujícími pokyny pro bezpečnou práci:
• Před uvedením zařízení do provozu je umístěte na rovný povrch.
• Nesnažte se zařízení opravit sami (s výjimkou případů, kdy je takový postup vysvětlen v dokumentaci Dell™ nebo v jiných 
pokynech poskytnutých společností Dell). Vždy se přesně řiďte instalačními a servisními pokyny.
• Nebezpečí úrazu elektrickým proudem se vyhnete, když nebudete připojovat ani odpojovat jakékoli kabely nebo provádět 
údržbu tohoto produktu během bouřky. Při bouřce základnu médií používejte pouze po odpojení všech kabelů, s počítačem 
napájeným z baterie.
• Pokud je do zařízení integrován nebo připojen (pomocí rozhraní PCMCIA) modem, v případě blížící se bouřky odpojte jeho 
kabel. Minimalizujete tak nebezpečí úrazu elektrickým proudem způsobeného úderem blesku do telefonního vedení.
• Do vývodů vzduchu ani jiných otvorů zařízení nevkládejte žádné předměty. Můžete tak způ
sobit požár nebo úraz elektrickým 
proudem (zkratují se vnitřní komponenty).
• Zařízení umístěte tak, aby nebylo v blízkosti topení a zdrojů tepla. Také nezakrývejte ventilátory. Nepokládejte pod zařízení 
volné listy papíru, neumíst’ujte zařízení do uzavřené nábytkové stěny ani na postel, pohovku či koberec.
• Nepoužívejte zařízení ve vlhkém prostředí, například v blízkosti vany, umyvadla, bazénu nebo ve vlhkém sklepě.
• Do počítače nesmí vniknout jídlo nebo tekutiny.
• Před čištěním zařízení odpojte z elektrické sítě. Zařízení čistěte měkkým hadříkem namočeným ve vodě. Nepoužívejte tekuté 
čističe nebo rozprašovače s obsahem hořlavin.
• Ujistěte se, že na napájecím kabelu není nic položeno a že o kabel nemůže nikdo zakopnout nebo na něj šlápnout.
• Zapnutý počítač neuchovávejte v prostředí se slabým větráním, například v uzavřeném kufříku nebo v pouzd
ře pro přenášení. Při 
nedostatečném proudění vzduchu hrozí poškození počítače nebo požár. 
• Nenechávejte přenosný počítač se zapojenou základnou delší dobu běžet na nechráněné kůži. Povrchová teplota základny během 
normálního provozu vzroste (zejména je-li připojen adaptér napájení). Dlouhodobý kontakt s nechráněnou kůží může způsobit 
nevolnost a časem i popáleniny.
• PC karty se během provozu mohou velmi zahřát. Po delším provozu vyjímejte PC karty velmi opatrně. 
• Do tohoto zařízení mohou být zapojeny jednotky optických disků (ODD), CD-ROM, CD-R/W, DVD a další, v nichž je 
zabudováno laserové zařízení. Tyto jednotky splňují bezpečnostní požadavky a spadají do první třídy klasifikace laserových 
zařízení podle standardu US DHHS a bezpečnostního standardu pro laserová zařízení EN/IEC60825-1. Tyto jednotky neobsahují 
žádné součástky, které by mohl uživatel sám nastavit, opravit nebo vyměnit. Otevřením nebo zablokováním jednotky ODD, at’ 
už z jakéhokoli důvodu, se vystavujete nebezpečí ozáření laserem.
VÝSTRAHA: 
Šňůra tohoto produktu obsahuje olovo, které podle zjištění státu Kalifornie způsobuje vrozené vady a jiná poškození 
reprodukčního systému. 
Po manipulaci si umyjte ruce

BEZPEČNOSTNÍ OPATŘENÍ: Bezpečnostní opatření pro elektrická zařízení
• Pokud vám byl spolu s produktem dodán i kabel zakončený zástrčkou se 3 kolíky, zapojte jej do uzemněné zásuvky. Zabráníte 
tak úrazu elektrickým proudem. Nepoužívejte zástrčky adaptéru ani neodstraňujte uzemňovací kolík ze zástrčky napájecího 
kabelu. Používejte pouze prodlužovací kabely s typem zásuvky odpovídajícím zástrčce napájecího kabelu. 
• Používáte-li prodlužovací kabel, ujistěte se, že celkové ampérové zatížení všech zapojených produktů nepřekračuje maximální 
ampérové zatížení pro daný prodlužovací kabel.
• Používejte pouze adaptér střídavého proudu dodávaný společností Dell, schválený pro použití s tímto zařízením. Použití jiného 
adaptéru může způsobit požár nebo explozi. Jmenovité hodnoty adaptéru střídavého napětí naleznete v uživatelských příručkách. 
• V případě použití rozdvojky buďte při zapojování napájecího kabelu velmi opatrní. Některé rozdvojky dovolují nesprávné 
zasunutí zástrčky. Nesprávné zasunutí může vyústit v trvalé poškození zařízení, elektrický zkrat a/nebo požár. Zemnící kolík 
zástrčky musí být vložen do odpovídající zemnící zdířky rozdvojky.
• Před zapojením zařízení do zásuvky zkontrolujte, zda napětí a frekvence adaptéru odpovídá hodnotám elektrické sítě. 
• Chcete-li odpojit počítač od všech zdrojů energie, vypněte po
čítač, odpojte adaptér ze zásuvky a všechny baterie, at’ už z přihrádky 
baterie nebo z modulární přihrádky. 
• Adaptér napájení při použití umístěte do místa s volným přístupem vzduchu, například na stůl nebo na podlahu. Nezakrývejte 
adaptér napájení papíry nebo jinými předměty, které by mohli zamezit odvětrávání; a nepoužívejte adaptér v pouzdře pro přenášení. 
• Adaptér napájení se během provozu počítače může velmi zahřát. Při použití během provozu nebo bezprostředně po něm buďte 
opatrní. 
• Norsko a Švédsko: Napájecí kabel připojujte pouze do uzemněné zásuvky. 
• Pouze pro Japonsko: Používejte pouze napájecí kabel dodávaný společností Dell. Použití jiného napájecího kabelu může způsobit 
poškození zařízení nebo adaptéru a zvyšuje riziko požáru nebo úrazu elektrickým proudem.
Pokyny pro ochranu zařízení
Abyste předešli poškození zařízení, řiďte se následujícími pokyny:
  UPOZORNĚNÍ: Při přenášení počítače z chladného místa do teplejšího prostředí (a naopak) předejdete poškození 
počítače tím, že před zapnutím umožníte přizpůsobení počítače nové teplotě a případné vypaření kondenzovaných 
par.
• Chraňte zařízení před riziky daného pracovního prostředí, jako je špína, prach, jídlo, tekutiny, teplotní extrémy a nadměrné 
vystavení slunečním paprskům.
• Nevystavujte zařízení dešti, nadměrné vlhkosti a extrémně vysokým či nízkým teplotám, aby podmínky nepřekročily stanovený 
provozní rozsah. 
• Umožněte dostatečné větrání tím, že z prostoru kolem větracích otvorů (nejméně 10,2 cm) odstraníte veškeré překážky. 
• Neomezujte přístup vzduchu zakrytím větracích otvorů a přívodů vzduchu. 
  VAROVÁNÍ: Před přepravou adaptéru napájení obalte obě šňůry stejně kolem adaptéru, jak je znázorněno 
na následujícím obrázku. Zamotání šňůr špatným směrem může způsobit jejich poškození, na něž se záruka 
na adaptér nevztahuje. Nikdy nepoužívejte adaptér, který nese známky poškození nebo nadměrného opotřebení.

Ochrana před elektrostatickým výbojem
Elektrostatické výboje mohou poškodit elektronické součástky uvnitř počítače. Za jistých podmínek se může na těle nebo na nějakém 
předmětu, například na periférii, nahromadit statická elektřina, která se pak vybije do jiného předmětu, jímž může být počítač. Abyste 
se předešli možnému poškození elektrostatickým výbojem, vybijte předtím, než se dotknete některé z vnitřních elektronických komponent 
(například pamět’ového modulu), ze svého těla statickou elektřinu. Před elektrostatickým výbojem se můžete ochránit tak, že se předtím, 
než se dotknete jakékoli elektroniky, dotknete uzemněného kovového předmětu (například nenatřeného kovového povrchu 
vstupního/výstupního panelu počítače). Před zapojením periférií (kapesní digitální diáře nevyjímaje) k počítači byste měli vždy uzemnit 
jak sebe, tak i periférii. Navíc je nutné se při práci uvnitř počítače opakovaně dotýkat vstupního/výstupního konektoru, abyste se zbavili 
jakékoli statické elektřiny, která se mohla v t
ěle nahromadit.
Abyste zabránili poškození způsobenému elektrostatickým výbojem, můžete dále provést následující kroky:
• Když vybalujete komponentu citlivou na statickou elektřinu z obalu, vyjměte ji z antistatického obalu, až když budete připraveni 
provést vlastní instalaci. Bezprostředně před rozbalením antistatického obalu vybijte statickou elektřinu ze svého těla.
• Přepravujete-li citlivou komponentu, nejdříve ji vložte do antistatické nádoby nebo obalu.
• Se všemi komponentami citlivými na statickou elektřinu manipulujte v oblasti bezpečné z hlediska statické elektřiny. Je-li to 
možné, použijte antistatickou rohožku a pracovní podložky.

Installationsvejledning for mediebase 57
ADVARSEL: Sikkerhedsinstruktioner
Brug de følgende sikkerhedsretningslinjer af hensyn til din egen sikkerhed og for at beskytte din enhed (computer, portreplikator, 
mediebase, dockingstation og lignende enheder) og dit arbejdsmiljø mod potentielle skader.
SIKKERHED: Generel sikkerhed
Overhold de følgende retningslinjer for sikker håndtering af hensyn til din egen og andre personers sikkerhed:
• Når du gør enheden klar til brug, skal du placere den på en jævn overflade.
• Forsøg ikke selv at servicere enheden, med mindre det er forklaret i din Dell™-dokumentation eller i andre instruktioner fra 
Dell. Følg altid installations- og serviceringsinstruktionerne nøje.
• For at undgå fare for elektrisk stød må du ikke tilslutte eller frakoble nogen kabler eller foretage vedligeholdelse eller 
omkonfiguration af dette produkt i tordenvejr. Brug ikke mediebasen i tordenvejr, med mindre alle kabler er frakoblet, 
og computeren kører på batteristrøm.
• Hvis din enhed har et integreret eller valgfrit modem (PC Card), skal du frakoble modemkablet, hvis det trækker op til 
tordenvejr. På den måde undgår du den lille risiko for at få elektrisk stød af tordenvejret via telefonledningen.
• Skub ikke nogen genstande ind i enhedens lufthuller eller åbninger. Dette kan forårsage brand eller elektrisk stød som følge 
af kortslutning af interne komponenter.
• Hold enheden på afstand af radiatorer og varmekilder. Undgå også at blokere kølehullerne. Undgå at placere løse papirer 
under enheden. Placer ikke enheden i et lukket vægmodul eller på en seng, en sofa eller et tæppe.
• Brug ikke enheden i et vådt miljø som for eksempel i nærheden af et badekar, en vask, en swimmingpool eller i en våd kælder.
• Undgå at spilde mad eller væsker på computeren.
• Inden du rengør enheden, skal du koble enheden fra stikkontakten. Rengør enheden med en blød klud fugtet med vand. 
Brug ikke flydende rengøringsmidler eller rengøringsmidler på spraydåse, der kan indeholde letantændelige stoffer.
• Sørg for, at der ikke hviler noget på AC-adapterens strømledning og at ledningen ikke er placeret på et sted, hvor man kan 
falde over den eller træde på den.
• Opbevar ikke computeren i et miljø med lav luftgennemstrømning, f.eks. i en mappe eller i en lukket taske, mens den er 
tændt. Hæmningen af luftgennemstrømningen kan beskadige computeren eller forårsage brand. 
• Lad ikke den bærbare computer køre med bunden hvilende direkte på bar hud i længere tid. Bundens overfladetemperatur 
vil stige under normal drift (især når der er tilsluttet AC-netstrøm). Længere tids kontakt med bar hud kan medføre utilpashed 
eller (efter længere tid) forbrændinger.
• PC Cards kan blive meget varme under normal brug. Vær forsigtig, når du fjerner PC Cards, efter at de har været anvendt 
i længere tid. 
• Denne enhed kan indeholde optiske diskdrev (ODD), cd-rom, CD-RW, dvd osv., som indeholder indbyggede laserenheder. 
Disse ODD'er overholder sikkerhedskravene og er klassificeret som "Klasse 1 Laserprodukter" i henhold til den amerikanske 
DHHS-standard og lasersikkerhedsstandarden EN/IEC60825-1. Disse ODD'er indeholder ikke nogen muligheder for 
brugerjusteringer eller servicerbare eller udskiftelige dele. For at undgå enhver risiko for at blive udsat for laserstråling 
må du under ingen omstændigheder deaktivere eller åbne ODD-modulet.
ADVARSEL: 
Ledningen på dette produkt indeholder bly, som er et kemikalie, der i State of California er kendt for at forårsage 
fødselsdefekter eller andre former for reproduktionsskader.

SIKKERHED: Strømsikkerhed
• Hvis dette produkt er udstyret med en 3-benet lysnetledning, skal du sørge for at sætte det direkte i en korrekt jordet 
strømforsyning for at bidrage til at undgå elektrisk stød. Brug ikke adapterstik, og fjern ikke jordingsbenet fra lysnetledningens 
stik. Hvis du bruger en forlængerledning, skal du bruge en type, der passer til stikket på adapterens lysnetledning. 
• Hvis du bruger en forlængerledning sammen med din AC-adapter, skal du sørge for, at de samlede amperedata for de 
produkter, der er tilsluttet forlængerledningen, ikke overstiger forlængerledningens amperedata.
• Brug kun den AC-adapter, som Dell leverer og som er godkendt til brug med denne enhed. Anvendelse af en anden AC-adapter 
kan medføre brand eller eksplosioner. Oplysninger om AC-adapterens elektriske data finder du i din brugervejledning eller 
i din ejerhåndbog. 
• Hvis du bruger en stikdåse med flere stik, skal du være forsigtig, når du sætter AC-adapterens strømledning i stikdåsen. 
I nogle stikdåser er det muligt at sætte stikket forkert i. Hvis lysnetstikket sættes forkert i, kan det medføre permanente 
skader på enheden og risiko for elektrisk stød og/eller brand. Sørg for at sætte lysnetstikkets jordingsben i den tilsvarende 
jordede kontakt i stikdåsen.
• Inden du tilslutter enheden til en stikkontakt, skal du kontrollere AC-adapterens spændingsdata for at sikre, at den krævede 
spænding og frekvens stemmer overens med den tilgængelige strømforsyning. 
• Hvis du vil fjerne computeren fra alle strømforsyninger, skal du slukke computeren, koble AC-adapteren fra stikkontakten og 
fjerne alle batterier, der er installeret i batteribåsen eller modulbåsen. 
• Placer AC-adapteren i et udluftet område som f.eks. på et skrivebord eller på gulvet, når du bruger den til at strømforsyne 
computeren eller til at oplade batteriet. Dæk ikke AC-adapteren til med papirer eller andre genstande, der vil formindske 
afkølingen, og undgå at bruge AC-adapteren inde i en bæretaske. 
• AC-adapteren kan blive varm under computerenens normale drift. Vær forsigtig, når du håndterer adapteren under eller 
umiddelbart efter, at computeren har været i brug. 
• Norge og Sverige: Tilslut kun lysnetledningen til en jordet stikkontakt. 
• Kun Japan: Brug kun den AC-netstrømledning, som Dell har leveret, sammen med AC-adapteren. Hvis du bruger en anden 
lysnetledning, kan enheden eller AC-adapteren blive beskadiget, eller der kan være risiko for brand eller elektrisk stød.
Instruktioner for beskyttelse af udstyr
Overhold de følgende retningslinjer for at forhindre, at dit udstyr bliver beskadiget:
  MEDDELELSE: Når du flytter computeren fra forhold med lave temperaturer til et varmere miljø eller fra forhold med høje 
temperaturer til et koldere miljø, skal du give computeren tid til at tilpasse sig til rumtemperaturen og lade eventuel kondens 
fordampe, inden du tænder for strømmen. På den måde undgår du, at computeren beskadiges. 
• Beskyt enheden mod miljøfarer som f.eks. snavs, støv, mad, væsker, ekstreme temperaturer og for meget sollys.
• Hold enheden på afstand af direkte eller kraftig fugt og ekstremt høje eller lave temperaturer for at sikre, at computeren 
anvendes inden for det angivne driftsområde. 
• Sørg for en afstand på mindst 10,2 cm på alle udluftede sider af enheden for at muliggøre den luftgennemstrømning, der 
kræves for at opnå en korrekt udluftning. 
• Undgå at begrænse luftstrømmen ind i enheden ved at blokere lufthuller eller luftindtag. 
  PAS PÅ: Når du gør AC-adapteren klar til rejser, skal du rulle begge ledningens ender rundt om adapteren i den retning, der er 
vist på den følgende figur. Hvis du ikke ruller ledningerne på i den rigtige retning, kan det medføre skader på ledningerne, som 
ikke er omfattet af adapterens garanti. Brug aldrig en AC-adapter, der udviser tegn på skader eller for voldsomt slid.

--- Page 61 ---
Installationsvejledning for mediebase 59
Beskyttelse mod elektrostatisk afladning
Elektrostatisk afladning (ESD) kan skade elektroniske komponenter inde i computeren. Under visse forhold kan der ophobes ESD 
på din krop eller på en genstand som f.eks. en ydre enhed, som derefter aflades til en anden genstand som f.eks. computeren. For at 
forhindre skader som følge af ESD bør du aflade den statiske elektricitet fra din krop, inden du rører nogen af computerens interne 
elektroniske komponenter som f.eks. et hukommelsesmodul. Du kan beskytte computeren mod ESD ved at røre ved en metalgenstand 
med jordforbindelse (f.eks. en umalet metaloverflade på computerens I/O-panel), inden du rører ved nogen elektroniske komponenter. 
Når du tilslutter en ydre enhed (herunder håndholdte computere) til computeren, skal du altid jorde både dig dig selv og den ydre 
enhed, inden du tilslutter den ydre enhed til computeren. Hvis du arbejder inde i computeren, bør du desuden jævnligt røre ved et 
I/O-stik for at fjerne den statiske elektricitet, som kan have samlet sig på din krop.
Du kan også tage de følgende forholdsregler for at forhindre skader som følge af elektrostatisk afladning:
• Når du pakker en statisk-følsom komponent ud af dens forsendelsesemballage, må du ikke fjerne komponenten fra den 
antistatiske emballage, før du er klar til at installere komponenten. Umiddelbart inden du åbner den antistatiske emballage, 
skal du sørge for at aflade den statiske elektricitet fra din krop.
• Når du transporterer en følsom komponent, skal du først placere den i en antistatisk beholder eller i antistatisk emballage.
• Håndter alle statisk-følsomme komponenter i et antistatisk område. Hvis det er muligt, bør du bruge antistatisk 
gulvunderlag og skrivebordsunderlag.

Installation af mediebasen
  PAS PÅ: AC-adapteren fungerer med stikkontakter over hele verden. Imidlertid er der forskel på stikkontakterne 
og stikdåserne i de forskellige lande. Hvis du bruger et inkompatibelt kabel eller tilslutter kablet forkert til 
stikdåsen eller stikkontakten, kan det medføre brand eller skader på udstyr.
 
MEDDELELSE: Brug altid den Dell AC-adapter, der fulgte med mediebasen. Hvis du bruger en anden almindelig 
AC-adapter – eller AC-adapteren fra ældre Dell-computermodeller – risikerer du at beskadige mediebasen eller 
computeren.
 
MEDDELELSE: Når du kobler Dell AC-adapterkablet fra computeren eller mediebasen, skal du tage fat i stikket 
(ikke i selve kablet) og trække fast, men forsigtigt, for at undgå at beskadige kablet. Hvis du ruller AC-adapterkablet 
op, skal du sørge for at følge vinklen for stikket på AC-adapteren, så du undgår at beskadige kablet.
1
Tilslut AC-adapteren til AC-adapterstikket og til en stikkontakt.
2
Inden du docker computeren for første gang, skal operativsystemet have gennemført 
konfigurationsprocessen. Sådan kontrollerer du, om operativsystemet har gennemført 
konfigurationsprocessen:
a
Sørg for, at computeren ikke er tilsluttet mediebasen (tildocket).
b
Tænd computeren.
c
Kontroller, at skrivebordet i Microsoft
®
 Windows
®
 vises. 
d
Sluk computeren via menuen 
Start
 i Windows.

Tietovälinepaikan asennusohje 79
HUOMIO: Turvallisuusohjeet
Noudata seuraavia turvallisuusohjeita, jotka auttavat takaamaan oman turvallisuutesi ja suojaamaan laitettasi (tietokonetta, 
porttitoistinta, tietovälinepaikkaa, telakointilaitetta ja vastaavia laitteita) sekä työskentelyolojasi mahdollisilta vahingoilta.
TURVALLISUUS: Yleinen turvallisuus
Noudata seuraavia turvallisuusohjeita henkilökohtaisen turvallisuutesi varmistamiseksi:
• Kun käytät laitetta, aseta se tasaiselle alustalle.
• Älä yritä huoltaa laitetta itse muulla tavoin kuin Dell™-dokumentaatiossa tai Dellin muulla tavoin toimittamissa ohjeissa on 
selitetty. Noudata aina tarkasti asennus- ja huolto-ohjeita.
• Jottei syntyisi sähköiskun vaaraa, älä liitä tai irrota mitään kaapeleita tai huolla laitteistoa tai muuta sen kokoonpanoa 
ukonilmalla. Älä käytä tietovälinepaikkaa ukonilman aikana, paitsi jos kaikki kaapelit on irrotettu ja tietokone toimii 
akkuvirralla.
• Jos laitteessasi on sisäinen modeemi tai valinnainen PC-korttimodeemi, irrota modeemin kaapeli ukonilman lähestyessä, 
jotta tietokone olisi turvassa puhelinlinjan kautta tulevilta sähköpurkauksilta.
• Älä työnnä esineitä laitteen tuuletusaukkoihin tai muihin aukkoihin. Jos teet niin, oikosulku sisäisissä osissa voi aiheuttaa 
tulipalon tai sähköiskun.
• Pidä laite poissa lämpöpattereiden ja muiden lämmönlähteiden läheltä. Älä myöskään tuki ilmanvaihtoaukkoja. Älä aseta 
irtopapereita laitteen alle äläkä sijoita sitä suljettuun seinäkaappiin tai vuoteelle, sohvalle tai matolle.
• Älä käytä laitetta kosteassa ympäristössä, esimerkiksi kylpyammeen, pesu- tai uima-altaan lähellä tai kosteassa 
kellarikerroksessa.
• Älä pudota ruokaa tai nesteitä tietokoneen päälle.
• Irrota laite sähköpistorasiasta ennen sen puhdistusta. Puhdista laite vedellä kostutetulla pehmeällä kankaalla. Älä käytä 
nestemäisiä tai aerosolipuhdistusaineita, joissa saattaa olla helposti syttyviä aineosia.
• Varmista, ettei verkkolaitteen johdon päällä ole esineitä ja että johto on sellaisessa paikassa, jossa siihen ei voi kompastua 
eikä sitä voi talloa.
• Älä säilytä käynnissä olevaa tietokonetta ilmatiiviissä tilassa, kuten kuljetuskotelossa tai suljetussa salkussa. Jos ilman 
vaihtuminen estetään, tietokone voi vahingoittua tai voi syttyä tulipalo. 
• Älä pidä kannettavaa tietokonetta pitkiä aikoja paljasta ihoa vasten. Alustan pintalämpötila kasvaa normaalin käytön aikana 
(varsinkin verkkovirtaa käytettäessä). Pitkäaikainen ihokosketus voi tuntua epämukavalta tai johtaa jopa palovammaan.
• PC-kortit voivat lämmetä voimakkaasti normaalikäytössä. Ole varovainen, kun poistat PC-kortin, joka on ollut jatkuvassa 
käytössä pitkän aikaa. 
• Tässä laitteessa voi olla optinen levyasema (ODD), CD-ROM, CDR/W, DVD jne., jossa on sisäänrakennettuna laserlaite. 
Optiset levyasemat ovat turvallisuusvaatimusten mukaisia ja ne on luokiteltu "luokan 1 lasertuotteiksi" US DHHS -
standardin ja EN/IEC60825-1 -laserturvallisuusstandardin mukaisesti. Näissä optisissa levyasemissa ei ole käyttäjän 
säädettävissä, huollettavissa tai vaihdettavissa olevia osia. Jotta lasersäteilylle altistumisen vaara voidaan välttää, älä poista 
käytöstä tai avaa optista levyasemaa mistään syystä.
VAROITUS: 
Tämän tuotteen johto sisältää lyijyä, joka on Kalifornian osavaltion mukaan kemikaali, joka aiheuttaa synnynnäisiä 
vammoja tai muita lisääntymiseen liittyviä ongelmia. 
Pese kätesi johdon käsittelemisen jälkeen.

TURVALLISUUS: Sähköturvallisuus
• Jos tämän tuotteen mukana tuli 3-napainen sähkökaapeli, kytke se oikein maadoitettuun pistorasiaan, jotta sähköiskun vaara 
voidaan välttää. Älä käytä sovitinpistokkeita tai irrota maadoituspiikkiä kaapelin liittimestä. Jos käytät jatkojohtoa, käytä 
asianmukaista jatkojohtoa verkkolaitteen liittimen kytkemistä varten. 
• Jos verkkolaitteen kanssa käytetään jatkojohtoa, varmista, ettei jatkojohtoon kytkettyjen laitteiden kokonaisampeeriluku ylitä 
jatkojohdon ampeerilukua.
• Käytä vain Dellin toimittamaa verkkolaitetta, joka on hyväksytty käytettäväksi tämän laitteen kanssa. Muiden verkkolaitteiden 
käyttäminen voi aiheuttaa tulipalon tai räjähdyksen. Katso käyttöohjeesta verkkolaitteen sähköiset nimellisarvot. 
• Jos jatkojohdossa on monipistorasia, kytke verkkolaitteen johto huolellisesti monipistorasiaan. Joissakin jatkojohdoissa liitin 
on mahdollista kytkeä väärin. Jos virtajohdon liitin kytketään väärin, tietokoneelle saattaa aiheutua pysyviä vahinkoja. Lisäksi 
aiheutuu sähköiskun tai tulipalon vaara. Varmista, että virtakaapelin liittimen maadoitusliitin on laitettu jatkojohdon 
maadoituskontaktiin.
• Ennen kuin kytket tietokoneen pistorasiaan, varmista, että verkkolaitteen jännite ja taajuus vastaavat käytettävissä olevaa 
verkkovirtaa. 
• Katkaise tietokoneesta sähkövirta kokonaan sammuttamalla tietokone, poistamalla akut akkupaikasta ja moduulipaikasta 
sekä irrottamalla verkkolaitteen liitin pistorasiasta. 
• Aseta verkkolaite avoimeen paikkaan (esimerkiksi pöydälle tai lattialle) silloin, kun se on käytössä tai kun akkua ladataan. Älä 
peitä verkkolaitetta papereilla tai muilla esineillä, jotka heikentävät jäähdytystä, äläkä käytä verkkolaitetta kantolaukun 
sisällä. 
• Verkkolaite saattaa kuumentua tietokoneen normaalin käytön aikana. Ole varovainen, kun käsittelet sitä käytön aikana tai 
heti sen jälkeen. 
• Norja ja Ruotsi: Kytke virtajohto vain maadoitettuun sähköpistorasiaan. 
• Vain Japani: Käytä vain Dellin toimittamaa virtajohtoa ja virtalaitetta. Minkä tahansa muun virtajohdon käyttö voi 
vahingoittaa konetta tai virtalaitetta tai aiheuttaa tulipalon tai sähköiskun vaaran.
Laitteiston suojausohjeet
Noudata seuraavia turvallisuusohjeita estääksesi laitteiston vahingoittumisen:
  VAROITUS: Kun siirrät tietokoneen kylmästä lämpimään tai päinvastoin, odota, että lämpötilaero tasaantuu ja mahdollisesti 
tiivistynyt kosteus haihtuu, ennen kuin käynnistät tietokoneen, jotta tietokone ei vaurioidu. 
• Suojaa laite ympäristön lialta, pölyltä, ruoka-aineilta, nesteiltä, hyvin korkeilta tai matalilta lämpötiloilta, liialliselta 
auringonvalolta ja muilta vaaratekijöiltä.
• Säilytä laite poissa suorasta tai liiallisesta kosteudesta ja erittäin kuumasta tai kylmästä lämpötilasta. Näin varmistetaan, että 
tietokonetta käytetään määritetyissä käyttöolosuhteissa. 
• Jätä vähintään 10,2 cm:n tila laitteen kaikille ilmanvaihtoaukoille, jotta ilmanvaihto on asianmukaista. 
• Älä estä ilmavirtausta laitteeseen tukkimalla ilmanvaihtoaukkoja tai ilmanottoaukkoja. 
  VAARA: Kun valmistelet verkkolaitetta kuljetusta varten, kierrä molemmat johdot samansuuntaisesti laitteen ympäri kuvan 
mukaisesti. Jos johdot kierretään vääränsuuntaisesti, ne voivat vahingoittua, eikä laitteen takuu ehkä kata vahinkoja. Älä 
koskaan käytä verkkolaitetta, joka on vahingoittunut tai liian kulunut.

Tietovälinepaikan asennusohje 81
Suojautuminen sähköstaattiselta purkaukselta
Sähköstaattiset purkaukset voivat vahingoittaa tietokoneesi elektronisia osia. Tietyissä oloissa sähköstaattista varausta voi kerääntyä 
kehoon tai esineeseen, kuten lisälaitteeseen, ja purkautua toiseen esineeseen, esimerkiksi tietokoneeseen. Voit estää sähköstaattisten 
purkausten aiheuttamat vahingot purkamalla kehosi sähkövarauksen ennen kuin kosket mihinkään tietokoneesi sisällä olevaan 
osaan, kuten muistimoduuliin. Voit suojautua sähköstaattisilta purkauksilta koskettamalla maadoitettua metalliesinettä (kuten 
tietokoneen I/O-paneelin maalaamatonta metallipintaa), ennen kuin kosketat mitään sähköistä osaa. Kun liität lisälaitetta (mukaan 
lukien kämmenmikroja) tietokoneeseen, maadoita aina sekä itsesi että lisälaite ennen kuin liität sen tietokoneeseen. Lisäksi, kun 
jatkat tietokoneen sisäosan käsittelyä, kosketa aika ajoin I/O-liitintä, jolloin kehoosi mahdollisesti kerääntynyt staattinen varaus 
poistuu.
Voit välttää staattisen sähkön purkauksista aiheutuvat vauriot myös noudattamalla seuraavia varotoimia:
• Kun purat komponentin pakkauslaatikosta, älä poista sitä antistaattisesta pakkauksesta, ennen kuin olet valmis asentamaan 
sen. Muista johtaa staattinen sähkö pois kehostasi juuri ennen kuin avaat antistaattisen pakkauksen.
• Kun kuljetat herkkää osaa, pane se ensin antistaattiseen rasiaan tai pakkaukseen.
• Käsittele kaikkia sähköstaattisesti herkkiä osia staattiselta sähköltä suojatulla alueella. Mikäli mahdollista, käytä antistaattisia 
lattia-alustoja ja työistuinalustoja.

Säädöksiä
Sähkömagneettinen häiriö (EMI) tarkoittaa signaalia tai säteilyä, joka siirtyy vapaassa tilassa tai voima- tai signaalilinjojen 
välityksellä ja vaarantaa radionavigoinnin tai muun turvapalvelun toimintaa tai heikentää, estää tai toistuvasti keskeyttää 
luvanvaraisen radioviestintäpalvelun toiminnan. Radioviestintäpalveluja ovat muun muassa AM/FM-radiolähetykset, 
televisiolähetykset, matkapuhelinpalvelut, tutka, lennonjohto, hakulaitteet ja Personal Communication Services (PCS) -palvelut. 
Sähkömagneettiseen ympäristöön vaikuttavat näiden luvanvaraisten palvelujen lisäksi tahattomat säteilylähteet, esimerkiksi 
tietokoneet ja muut digitaaliset laitteet.
Sähkömagneettisella yhteensopivuudella (EMC) tarkoitetaan sähkölaitteiden kykyä toimia yhdessä oikein sähkömagneettisessa 
ympäristössä. Tämä tietokone on suunniteltu siten, että sen aiheuttama sähkömagneettinen häiriö on säädösten sallimissa rajoissa, 
mutta häiriöitä voi silti esiintyä tietyissä käyttökohteissa. Sammuttamalla laitteen ja käynnistämällä sen uudelleen voit tarkistaa, 
aiheuttaako laite häiriöitä radioviestintäpalveluissa. Voit koettaa poistaa mahdollisia häiriöitä seuraavilla toimenpiteillä:
• Suuntaa vastaanottimen antenni uudelleen.
• Muuta tietokoneen paikkaa suhteessa vastaanottimeen.
• Siirrä tietokone kauemmaksi vastaanottimesta.
• Kytke tietokone toiseen pistorasiaan, niin että tietokone ja vastaanotin eivät ole samassa virtapiirissä.
Ota tarvittaessa yhteyttä Dellin tukeen tai radio- ja televisiotekniikkaan erikoistuneeseen henkilöön. 
Lisätietoja säännöksistä on tietokoneen Omistajan oppaassa tai Käyttöoppaassa.

Οδηγίες για την προστασία του εξοπλισµού
Τηρήστε πιστά τις ακόλουθες κατευθυντήριες οδηγίες που αφορούν θέµατα ασφάλειας για να αποφύγετε ζηµιά στον εξοπλισµό σας:
  ΕΙ∆ΟΠΟΙΗΣΗ: Όταν µεταφέρετε τον υπολογιστή από χώρο όπου επικρατούν συνθήκες χαµηλής θερµοκρασίας 
σε θερµότερο περιβάλλον ή από χώρο όπου επικρατούν συνθήκες υψηλής θερµοκρασίας σε ψυχρότερο περιβάλλον, 
προς αποφυγή βλάβης αφήστε τον να προσαρµοστεί στη θερµοκρασία του χώρου και να εξατµιστεί η συµπύκνωση 
υδρατµών που ενδεχοµένως έχει δηµιουργηθεί λόγω αλλαγής θερµοκρασίας προτού τον
 θέσετε σε λειτουργία. 
• Προστατέψτε τη συσκευή σας από περιβαλλοντικούς κινδύνους όπως βροµιά, σκόνη, φαγητό, υγρά, ακραίες θερµοκρασίες 
και υπερβολική έκθεση στο φως του ήλιου.
• Μην εκθέτετε τη συσκευή σε απευθείας ή υπερβολική υγρασία και άκρως υψηλές ή χαµηλές θερµοκρασίες. Έτσι, θα 
διασφαλίσετε ότι η χρήση του υπολογιστή γίνεται στο 
καθορισµένο εύρος λειτουργίας. 
• Αφήνετε κενό χώρο τουλάχιστον 10,2 εκατοστών (4 ιντσών) γύρω από κάθε εξαεριζόµενη πλευρά της συσκευής ώστε να 
υπάρχει η απαιτούµενη ροή αέρα για σωστό εξαερισµό. 
• Μην περιορίζετε τη ροή αέρα µέσα στη συσκευή φράσσοντας. τις θυρίδες εξαερισµού ή εισροής αέρα.

Προστασία έναντι ηλεκτροστατικής εκφόρτισης
Τα περιστατικά ηλεκτροστατικής εκφόρτισης (ESD) ενδέχεται να προκαλέσουν ζηµιά σε ηλεκτρονικά εξαρτήµατα µέσα στον υπολογιστή 
σας. Κάτω από ορισµένες συνθήκες, ενδέχεται να συσσωρευθεί ESD επάνω στο σώµα σας ή σε κάποιο αντικείµενο, όπως µια 
περιφερειακή συσκευή, και ύστερα να διοχετευτεί µέσα σε κάποιο άλλο αντικείµενο, όπως ο υπολογιστής σας. Για να αποφύγετε ζηµιές
 
λόγω ESD, θα πρέπει να αποβάλλετε το στατικό ηλεκτρισµό από το σώµα σας προτού έλθετε σε επαφή µε κάποιο από τα εσωτερικά 
ηλεκτρονικά εξαρτήµατα του υπολογιστή σας, όπως η µονάδα µνήµης. Μπορείτε να προστατευτείτε από την ESD αγγίζοντας ένα 
µεταλλικό γειωµένο αντικείµενο (όπως κάποια άβαφη µεταλλική επιφάνεια επάνω στο πλαίσιο I/O του υπολογιστή 
σας) προτού έλθετε σε 
επαφή µε οποιοδήποτε ηλεκτρονικό εξάρτηµα. Κατά τη σύνδεση περιφερειακών συσκευών (συµπεριλαµβανοµένων των ψηφιακών 
βοηθών χειρός) µε τον υπολογιστή σας, θα πρέπει πάντα να υπάρχει γείωση τόσο για εσάς όσο και για την περιφερειακή συσκευή προτού 
γίνει η σύνδεση µε τον υπολογιστή σας. Παράλληλα, όση ώρα δουλεύετε στο
 εσωτερικό του υπολογιστή, αγγίζετε κατά διαστήµατα ένα 
σύνδεσµο I/O για να αποβάλλετε από το σώµα σας στατικά φορτία που ίσως έχουν συσσωρευτεί.
Επίσης µπορείτε να λάβετε τα ακόλουθα µέτρα για να αποφύγετε ζηµιά από ηλεκτροστατική εκφόρτιση:
• Όταν αποσυσκευάζετε από το κιβώτιο αποστολής εξαρτήµατα που είναι ευαίσθητα σε στατικό ηλεκτρισµό, µην αποµακρύνετε
 
το κάθε εξάρτηµα από το αντιστατικό υλικό συσκευασίας ωσότου είστε έτοιµοι να το εγκαταστήσετε. Ακριβώς προτού ανοίξετε 
την αντιστατική συσκευασία, φροντίστε να αποβάλετε το στατικό ηλεκτρισµό από το σώµα σας.
• Όταν µεταφέρετε κάποιο ευαίσθητο εξάρτηµα, φροντίστε προηγουµένως να το τοποθετήσετε µέσα σε αντιστατική θήκη 
ή συσκευασία.
• Ο χειρισµός όλων 
των εξαρτηµάτων που είναι ηλεκτροστατικά ευαίσθητα πρέπει να γίνεται σε χώρους χωρίς στατικό 
ηλεκτρισµό. Αν είναι δυνατό, χρησιµοποιείτε αντιστατικά πατάκια δαπέδου και καλύµµατα του πάγκου εργασίας.

Ανακοινώσεις περί ρυθµιστικών κανονισµών
Ηλεκτροµαγνητική παρεµβολή (EMI) είναι κάθε σήµα ή εκποµπή που ακτινοβολείται σε ελεύθερο χώρο ή πραγµατοποιείται κατά 
µήκος αγωγών ισχύος ή σήµατος και θέτει σε κίνδυνο την οµαλή λειτουργία της ραδιοπλοήγησης ή άλλων υπηρεσιών ασφαλείας 
ή υποβαθµίζει σοβαρά, παρεµποδίζει ή επανειληµµένα διακόπτει αδειοδοτηµένες υπηρεσίες ραδιοεπικοινωνιών. Οι υπηρεσίες 
ραδιοεπικοινωνιών περιλαµβάνουν, αλλά δεν περιορίζονται σε
, εµπορική ευρυεκποµπή AM/FM, τηλεόραση, κυψελοειδείς υπηρεσίες, 
ραντάρ, έλεγχο εναέριας κυκλοφορίας, δέκτες τηλεειδοποίησης και υπηρεσίες προσωπικών επικοινωνιών (PCS). Αυτές οι αδειοδοτηµένες 
υπηρεσίες καθώς και οι ακούσιοι ακτινοβολητές όπως οι ψηφιακές συσκευές, συµπεριλαµβανοµένων των συστηµάτων υπολογιστή, 
συµβάλλουν στο ηλεκτροµαγνητικό περιβάλλον.
Ηλεκτροµαγνητική συµβατότητα (EMC) είναι η δυνατότητα στοιχείων ηλεκτρονικού εξοπλισµού να λειτουργούν κατάλληλα µαζί στο 
ηλεκτρονικό 
περιβάλλον. Ενώ ο παρών υπολογιστής έχει σχεδιαστεί και καθοριστεί να συµµορφώνεται µε τα όρια των ρυθµιστικών 
φορέων όσον αφορά την EMI, δεν υπάρχει καµία εγγύηση ότι δεν θα προκύψει παρεµβολή σε κάποια συγκεκριµένη εγκατάσταση. Αν 
ο συγκεκριµένος εξοπλισµός όντως προκαλέσει παρεµβολή σε υπηρεσίες ραδιοεπικοινωνιών, γεγονός που µπορεί να εξακριβωθεί 
θέτοντας τον εξοπλισµό
 εντός και εκτός λειτουργίας, συνιστούµε να προσπαθήσετε να διορθώσετε την παρεµβολή µε την εφαρµογή 
ενός ή περισσότερων από τα ακόλουθα µέτρα:
• Αλλάξτε τον προσανατολισµό της κεραίας λήψης.
• Αλλάξτε τη θέση του υπολογιστή σε σχέση µε τον δέκτη.
• Αποµακρύνετε τον υπολογιστή από το δέκτη.
• Συνδέστε τον υπολογιστή σε διαφορετικό 
ρευµατολήπτη έτσι ώστε ο υπολογιστής και ο δέκτης να ανήκουν σε διαφορετικούς 
κλάδους κυκλώµατος.
Αν χρειαστεί, συµβουλευτείτε κάποιον αντιπρόσωπο της Dell ή κάποιον έµπειρο τεχνικό ραδιοφώνων/τηλεοράσεων που είναι σε θέση 
να σας προτείνει και άλλες λύσεις.

VIGYÁZAT! Biztonsági előírások
Saját személyének, valamint berendezéseinek (számítógép, bővítőegységek, Media Base, dokkolóállomás és hasonló eszközök) biztonsága, 
valamint a munkakörnyezet esetleges károsodásoktól történő védelme érdekében tartsa be a jelen munkabiztonsági útmutató előírásait.
BIZTONSÁG: Általános biztonság
A személyi biztonság érdekében tartsa be a biztonságos működtetésre vonatkozó következő irányelveket:
• Telepítéskor helyezze az eszközt vízszintes felületre.
• Ne végezze saját kezűleg az eszköz javítását vagy karbantartását, kivéve, ha a Dell™ dokumentáció erre kifejezett utasítást ad. 
Mindig pontosan tartsa be a telepítési és karbantartási utasításokat.
• Az áramütés veszélyének elkerülése érdekében, villámlással kísért vihar idején ne csatlakoztasson, illetve ne húzzon ki egyetlen 
kábelt sem, és ne végezzen sem karbantartást, sem beállítást a terméken. Villámlással kísért vihar idején tilos használni a Media 
Base eszközöket, kivéve, ha minden kábel ki van húzva és a számítógép akkumulátorról üzemel.
• Ha a berendezéshez integrált vagy opcionális (PC-kártyás) modem tartozik, és villámlással kísért vihar közeledik, húzza ki 
a modem kábelét, hogy elkerülje a villámcsapás okozta károsodást.
• Ne dugjon semmilyen tárgyat a berendezés szellőző- vagy egyéb nyílásaiba. A bedugott tárgyak rövidzárlatot okozhatnak, 
és tűz vagy áramütés keletkezhet.
• Tartsa távol a berendezést fűtőtestektől és hőforrásoktól egyaránt. Ne takarja el a hűtőnyílásokat! Ne tegyen papírlapot 
a berendezés alá; ne tegye a berendezést falmélyedésbe, sem ágyra, pamlagra vagy szőnyegre.
• Ne használja a berendezést nedves környezetben, például fürdőkád, mosogató vagy úszómedence közelében, illetve nedves 
alagsori helyiségben.
• Ne öntsön semmilyen ételt vagy folyadékot a számítógépre.
• A berendezést tisztítás előtt áramtalanítani kell (húzza ki a tápkábelt a dugaszoló aljzatból). A berendezést nedves, puha ronggyal 
lehet tisztítani. Ne használjon olyan folyékony vagy aeroszolos tisztítószereket, amelyek gyúlékony anyagokat tartalmaznak.
• A váltakozó áramú adapter tápkábelére ne tegyen semmilyen tárgyat, és olyan útvonalon vezesse, ahol senki sem botlik bele 
és nem lép rá.
• A bekapcsolt számítógépet nem szabad rosszul szellőző helyen, például csukott táskában tartani. Megfelelő szellőzés hiányában 
károsodhat a számítógép, vagy tűz keletkezhet. 
•
Hordozható számítógépét ne üzemeltesse úgy, hogy annak alja huzamosabb ideig fedetlen bőrrel érintkezik. Rendes működés 
közben a számítógép alja felmelegszik (különösen, ha a hálózatról üzemel). A fedetlen bőrrel történő huzamosabb érintkezés 
kellemetlen érzést, akár égési sérülést is okozhat.
• A bővítőkártyák a számítógép működése során nagyon felmelegedhetnek. Folyamatos működés után várja meg, amíg 
a bővítőkártyák lehűlnek, és csak utána vegye ki őket. 
• Ez a berendezés lézersugarat kibocsátó optikai meghajtókat, pl. CD-ROM-, CDR/W- vagy DVD-meghajtót tartalmazhat. Ezek az 
optikai meghajtók megfelelnek a biztonsági előírásoknak, és az amerikai DHHS szabvány, valamint az EN/IEC60825-1 sz. európai 
szabványok szerint 1. osztályú (Class 1) lézerberendezéseknek minősülnek. Az optikai meghajtókban semmilyen olyan alkatrész 
nincs, amelyet a felhasználó saját kezűleg javíthatna, beállíthatna vagy cserélhetne. A lézersugárzás okozta káros hatások 
megelőzése érdekében soha ne szerelje szét és ne nyissa ki az optikai lemezmeghajtókat.
FIGYELEM:
 E termék kábele ólmot tartalmaz, amely Kalifornia állam jogszabályai szerint születési rendellenességet vagy 
a nemzőszervek más jellegű károsodását idézheti elő. 
Ha a kábelt kézbe vette, utána mosson kezet.

BIZTONSÁG: Elektromos biztonságtechnika
• Ha a termékhez háromeres tápkábel tartozik, akkor az áramütés megelőzése érdekében ügyeljen arra, hogy a földelőkábel 
a konnektor megfelelő pólusára csatlakozzon. Ne használjon hosszabbítókat, és ne iktassa ki a tápkábelről a földelővezetéket. 
Csak olyan hosszabbítót szabad használni, amely illeszkedik az adapter dugaszához. 
• Ha a váltakozó áramú adaptert hosszabbítóval használja, ügyeljen arra, hogy a hosszabbítóra csatlakoztatott termékek névleges 
áramerőssége ne haladja meg a hosszabbító hasonló paraméterét.
• Kizárólag az eszközhöz kapott, a Dell által gyártott váltakozó áramú adaptert használja. Más típusú váltakozó áramú adapter 
használata tüzet vagy robbanást okozhat. A váltakozó áramú adapter névleges elektromos jellemzői megtalálhatók 
a Felhasználói kézikönyvben. 
• Ha több dugaszolóaljzatos elosztót használ, legyen körültekintő, amikor a váltakozó áramú adapter tápkábelét az elosztóba 
csatlakoztatja. Vannak elosztók, amelyekbe a dugasz helytelenül is csatlakoztatható. A tápkábel villásdugójának helytelen 
csatlakoztatása miatt a berendezés maradandóan károsodhat, illetve áramütés és/vagy tűz keletkezhet. Ügyeljen arra, 
hogy a tápkábel dugaszának földelővezetéke az elosztó megfelelő földelőágához legyen csatlakoztatva.
• Mielőtt a berendezést az elektromos hálózatra csatlakoztatná, ellenőrizze, hogy az áramforrás feszültsége és frekvenciája 
megfelel-e a váltakozó áramú adapternek. 
• Ha a számítógépet teljesen áramtalanítani szeretné, kapcsolja ki, húzza ki a váltakozó áramú adaptert a dugaszoló aljzatból, 
majd vegyen ki minden akkumulátort. 
• A számítógép működtetése vagy az akkumulátor feltöltése közben a váltakozó áramú adaptert jól szellőző helyre, például asztalra 
vagy a padlóra kell tenni. Ne takarja le az adaptert papírral vagy más, a hűtést akadályozó tárggyal, és ne használja 
a váltakozó áramú adaptert a hordtáskában. 
• A váltakozó áramú adapter a számítógép normális működése során felmelegedhet. Legyen óvatos, ha üzemeltetés közben vagy 
közvetlenül utána az adaptert meg kell fognia. 
• Norvégia és Svédország: A tápkábelt kizárólag földelt elektromos hálózatra csatlakoztassa. 
• Csak Japán: A váltakozó áramú adapterhez kizárólag a Dell által szállított tápkábelt használja. Bármely más tápkábel használata 
károsíthatja a berendezést vagy a váltakozó áramú adaptert, illetve tüzet vagy áramütést okozhat.
Biztonságtechnikai előírások
A berendezés károsodásának megelőzésére tartsa be a biztonságos működtetésre vonatkozó következő irányelveket:
  FIGYELMEZTETÉS: Ha a számítógép hidegből melegebb vagy melegből hidegebb környezetbe kerül, 
bekapcsolás előtt hagyja, hogy az a helyiség hőmérsékletét átvegye, és az alkatrészeken esetleg lecsapódott 
víz elpárologjon. Így elkerülhető a számítógép károsodása. 
• Óvja a berendezést a környezeti ártalmaktól, például piszok, por, étel, folyadék, szélsőséges hőmérséklet és erős napfény hatásától.
• A számítógépet az előírt körülmények között kell üzemeltetni, a hőmérséklet és a nedvességtartalom mindig a megadott határok 
között legyen. 
• A megfelelő szellőzéshez hagyjon legalább 10,2 cm térközt a berendezés összes szellőző oldalán. 
• Ügyeljen arra, hogy a berendezés szellőzése ne legyen akadályozva, a szellőző- vagy légbeszívó nyílások legyenek szabadok. 
  VIGYÁZAT! Utazás előtt a váltakozó áramú adapterre mindkét kábelt az alábbi ábrán látható módon, 
ugyanabban az irányban tekerje fel. A kábelek károsodhatnak, ha nem a megfelelő irányban tekeri fel őket, 
és erre a kárra a szavatosság nem vonatkozik. Soha ne használjon olyan adaptert, amelyiken sérülés vagy 
túlzott kopás jelei láthatók.

Az elektrosztatikus kisülés elleni védelem
Az elektrosztatikus kisülés (ESD) károsíthatja a számítógép elektronikus alkatrészeit. Bizonyos körülmények között 
elektrosztatikusság képződhet testünkön vagy valamilyen tárgyon, például egy periférián, amely aztán kisülhet egy másik tárgy, például 
a számítógép, felé. Az elektrosztatikus kisülések okozta károk megelőzése érdekében, mielőtt a gép valamelyik belső, elektronikus 
alkatrészéhez (például memóriamodul) nyúlna, süsse ki a testén felhalmozódott statikus elektromosságot. Az elektrosztatikus kisülések 
elleni védekezésül – mielőtt bármilyen elektronikus alkatrészhez nyúlna – érintsen meg valamilyen földelt fémtárgyat (például festetlen 
fémfelületet a számítógép I/O paneljén). Mielőtt egy perifériát (például kéziszámítógépet) a számítógépre csatlakoztatna, földelje le 
magát és a perifériát is. Amikor a számítógép belsejében dolgozik, időnként érintse meg valamelyik I/O csatlakozót, mert így kisüthet 
minden felgyülemlett elektrosztatikus töltést a testéről.
Az elektrosztatikus kisülés okozta károk megelőzése érdekében a következőket is teheti:
• Miután az elektrosztatikusságra érzékeny alkatrészeket kivette a dobozból, ne vegye le róluk az antisztatikus csomagolást addig, 
amíg nem kezdi el a szerelést. Közvetlenül az elektrosztatikus csomagolóanyag eltávolítása előtt süsse ki a testén lévő statikus 
elektromosságot.
• Érzékeny alkatrész szállításakor, előbb tegye azt antisztatikus ládába vagy csomagolóanyagba.
• Az elektrosztatikusságra érzékeny alkatrészeket csak elektrosztatikusságtól mentes helyen kezelje. Ha lehet, a padlóra vagy 
a munkaasztalra terítsen antisztatikus takarót.

Biztonsági figyelmeztetések
Elektromágneses zavar (EMI) minden olyan, nyílt térben sugárzott, vagy áramellátó vezetéken, illetve adatkábelen továbbított jel vagy 
sugárzás, amely a rádiós navigáció vagy más biztonsági szolgálat működését veszélyezteti, illetve valamely hatóságilag engedélyezett 
távközlési szolgáltatás működését jelentsen rontja, akadályozza vagy ismételten megszakítja. A távközlési szolgálatok körébe tartozik – 
a teljesség igénye nélkül – az AM/FM sávon történ kereskedelmi műsorszórás, a televízió, a mobiltelefonos szolgáltatások, a radar, 
a légiforgalom-irányítás, a személyhívó rendszerek, és a személyi távközlési szolgálatok (PCS). Ezek a hatósági engedélyköteles 
szolgálatok – olyan véletlenszerűen sugárzó forrásokkal, mint például a digitális berendezések, beleértve a számítástechnikai 
rendszereket is – közreműködnek az elektromágneses környezet kialakításában.
Az elektromágneses kompatibilitás (EMC) az elektronikus berendezések azon képessége, hogy elektronikus környezetben is megfelelően 
tudnak működni. Bár ezt a számítógépet az elektromágneses zavarokra vonatkozó hatósági előírásoknak megfelelően terveztük, és megkapta 
a hivatalos minősítést, nincs garancia arra, hogy néhány sajátos környezetben nem fordulhat el interferencia. Ha a berendezés be- és 
kikapcsolásakor azt tapasztaljuk, hogy zavart okoz valamely távközlési szolgáltatásban (rádió-összeköttetésben), a zavart a következő 
intézkedésekkel lehet kiküszöbölni:
• Tájolja más irányba a vevőantennát.
• Változtassa meg a számítógép és a zavart vevőkészülék egymáshoz viszonyított helyzetét.
• Helyezze a számítógépet távolabb a vevőkészüléktől.
• Csatlakoztassa a számítógépet egy másik dugaszolóaljzatba, hogy ne legyen vevőkészülékkel azonos áramkörön.
Ha szükséges, kérjen tanácsot a Dell ügyfélszolgálatától, vagy egy tapasztalt rádió- és tévészerelőtől. 
További előírásokat az illető készülék vagy a számítógép használati utasításában talál.
A Dell™ termékeket az előrelátható elektromágneses környezet figyelembevételével tervezik, tesztelik, illetve minősítik. Az elektromágneses 
hatásokkal kapcsolatos besorolások általában a következő általánosan elfogadott definíciókra utalnak:
• „A” osztály: sajátosan üzleti vagy ipari alkalmazások. „B” osztály: az „A” osztályú környezetben is használható termékek. 
• A „B” osztályú termékek jellegzetesen otthoni készülékek. Az „A” osztályú termékeket „B” osztályú környezetben nem lehet 
használni. 
Feltétel, hogy a számítógépbe beépített információtechnológiai berendezések (ITE) – beleértve a perifériákat, bővítőkártyákat, nyomtatókat, 
be-/kimeneti (I/O) eszközöket, monitorokat stb., amelyek egyébként a számítógépbe beépülnek vagy ahhoz csatlakoznak – feleljenek 
meg a számítógép elektromágneses besorolásának.
Árnyékolt adatkábelekre vonatkozó megjegyzés: Azért, hogy az elektromágneses interferenciát elkerüljük, a Dell termékeket és 
perifériáikat mindig árnyékolt kábelekkel kell összekötni. Az árnyékolt kábelek alkalmazásával biztosítható, hogy az adott 
környezet elektromágneses kompatibilitási besorolása megfelelő legyen. Párhuzamos nyomtatókhoz kapható Dell gyártmányú 
adatkábel. Ha kábelt szeretne rendelni a Dell cégtől, látogassa meg a következő honlapot: www.dell.com. 
Ez a Dell által forgalmazott kábel „B” osztályú, szabványos termék. A következő fejezetekben országfüggő EMC/EMI vagy 
termékbiztonsággal kapcsolatos, adatokkal szolgálunk.

Installasjonsveiledning for mediabase 145
OBS! Sikkerhetsinstruksjoner
Bruk de følgende sikkerhetsretningslinjene til å sikre deg selv og til å bidra til å beskytte utstyret (datamaskin, portreplikator, 
mediabase, forankringsstasjon og liknende utstyr) og arbeidsmiljøet mot potensiell ødeleggelse.
SIKKERHET: Generell sikkerhet
Ta vare på din personlige sikkerhet ved å ta hensyn til følgende retningslinjer for sikker håndtering:
• Når utstyret installeres for bruk, plasser det på en plan flate.
• Ikke forsøk å foreta noe vedlikehold på utstyret selv, unntatt som forklart i dokumentasjonen fra Dell™ eller ifølge 
instruksjoner du på annen måte har fått fra Dell. Følg alltid installasjons- og vedlikeholdsinstruksjonene nøye.
• For å unngå potensiell fare for elektrisk støt, ikke tilkople eller frakople noen kabler, og foreta heller ikke vedlikehold eller 
rekonfigurering, så lenge det er tordenvær. Ønsker du å bruke mediabasen under tordenvær, frakople alle kabler og bruk 
datamaskinen bare med batteridrift.
• Dersom utstyret inkluderer et innebygd modem eller et PC-kortmodem, og et tordenvær nærmer seg, frakople kabelen 
mellom telefonnettet og modemet for å unngå (den lite sannsynlige) risikoen for å få elektrisk støt som skyldes lyn via 
telefonledningen.
• Ikke skyv noen som helst gjenstand inn i ventilasjonsåpninger eller andre åpninger på utstyret. Dersom dette gjøres, kan det 
forårsake brann eller elektrisk støt ved at komponenter innvendig i utstyret kortslutter.
• Hold utstyret borte fra ovner og andre varmekilder. Ikke hindre luftstrømmen gjennom ventilasjonsåpningene. Unngå 
å plassere løse papirark under utstyret, og ikke plasser utstyret i et lukket skap, på en seng eller sofa, eller på et teppe.
• Ikke bruk utstyret der det er fuktig, for eksempel nær badekar, vask eller svømmebasseng, eller i en fuktig kjeller.
• Ikke søl mat eller væsker på datamaskinen.
• Før utstyret rengjøres, trekk ut nettledningen fra stikkontakten. Rengjør utstyret med en myk klut som er lett fuktet med 
vann. Ikke bruk rensemidler - verken flytende eller spraytype - som kan inneholde antennbare stoffer.
• Pass på at ingenting ligger på nettkabelen til strømforsyningen og at kabelen ikke er plassert slik at den kan bli tråkket på eller 
at noen snubler i den.
• Oppbevar ikke datamaskinen i et miljø med lite luftgjennomstrømning, for eksempel i en lukket koffert, mens den er på. 
For lite luftgjennomstrømning kan skade datamaskinen eller føre til brann. 
• Ikke bruk din bærbare datamaskin i lange perioder med undersiden plassert direkte på bar hud. Overflatetemperaturen på 
undersiden vil stige under normal drift (særlig når nettstrøm er i bruk). Langvarig kontakt med bar hud kan medføre plager 
og til sist brannsår.
• PC-kort kan bli svært varme under normal drift. Vis forsiktighet når PC-kort tas ut etter at de er brukt kontinuerlig. 
• Dette utstyret kan inneholde optiske stasjoner (ODD) av typene CD-ROM, CDR/W, DVD osv. som kan ha innebygd 
laserutstyr. Disse optiske stasjonene er i samsvar med offentlige sikkerhetskrav og er klassifisert som "Class 1 Laser Products" 
i henhold til US DHHS-standarden og lasersikkerhetsstandarden EN/IEC60825-1. Disse optiske stasjonene kan ikke justeres 
og inneholder ingen deler som kan vedlikeholdes eller skiftes ut. For å unngå risiko for å bli utsatt for laserstråling, må du 
under ingen omstendighet åpne eller ta fra hverandre en optisk stasjon.
OBS! 
Nettledningen for dette produktet inneholder bly, en kjemikalie som myndighetene i California kjenner til kan forårsake 
fødselsskader og andre reproduksjonsrelaterte skader. 
Vask hendene etter håndtering

SIKKERHET: Nettstrøm-sikkerhet
• Dersom dette produktet er utstyrt med jordingsstøpsel, pass på at støpslet tilkoples en jordet stikkontakt, for å hindre 
elektrisk støt. Ikke bruk ikke-jordete overgangskontakter eller på annen måte fjern jordtilkoplingen. Dersom du benytter 
skjøtekabel, bruk en type som har jordforbindelse. 
• Tilkopler du strømforsyningen en skjøtekabel, pass på at samlet strøm gjennom skjøtekabelen ikke overstiger den største 
strømmen skjøtekabelen er laget for.
• Bruk bare strømforsyningen som er levert av Dell sammen med dette utstyret. Bruk av en annen strømforsyning kan forårsake 
brann eller eksplosjon. Finn elektriske data for strømforsyningen i brukerhåndboken eller annen dokumentasjon som følger 
strømforsyningen. 
• Vær forsiktig når du setter støpslet på nettkabelen for strømforsyningen inn en stikkontakt med flere uttak. Noen slike 
stikkontakter gir mulighet for å tilkople støpslet på feil måte. Ukorrekt tilkopling av støpslet kan resultere i permanent skade på 
utstyret og kan også medføre fare for elektrisk støt og/eller brann. Pass på at jordtilkoplingen på støpslet blir riktig tilkoplet.
• Før du kopler utstyret til stikkontakten, pass på at nødvendig nettspenning og nettfrekvens for utstyret stemmer overens med 
nettspenning og frekvens i stikkontakten. 
• Skru datamaskinen av, trekk nettstøpslet ut av stikkontakten og fjern alle batterier fra batterirommet og eventuelt også fra 
modulrommet for å kople datamaskinen bort fra alle strømkilder. 
• Når strømforsyningen brukes til å gi strøm til datamaskinen eller lading av batteriet, plasser den et sted der det finnes 
ventilasjon, slik som oppå bordet eller på gulvet. Ikke tildekk strømforsyningen med papir eller annet som kan redusere 
kjølingen, og bruk heller ikke strømforsyningen når den er plassert inni en veske eller liknende. 
• Strømforsyningen kan bli varm ved normal drift av datamaskinen. Vis forsiktighet når du håndterer strømforsyningen mens 
den er i bruk, eller like etter. 
• Norge og Sverige: Sett nettstøpslet kun inn i en jordet stikkontakt. 
• Kun Japan: Bruk kun nettkabelen som er levert fra Dell sammen med strømforsyningen. Bruk av enhver annen nettkabel kan 
ødelegge utstyret eller gi fare for brann og elektrisk støt.
Instruksjoner for beskyttelse av utstyret
Ta hensyn til følgende retningslinjer for sikker håndtering, for å hindre skade på utstyret:
  ADVARSEL: Når datamaskinen flyttes fra et sted med lav temperatur til et sted som er varmere, eller fra et sted med høy 
temperatur til et sted som er kjøligere, unngår du skade på datamaskinen ved å vente med å skru den på til all fuktighet er 
fordampet og datamaskinen har fått samme temperatur som omgivelsene. 
• Beskytt utstyret mot smuss, støv, mat, væsker, ekstreme temperaturer og kraftig sollys.
• Pass på at datamaskinen holdes innenfor spesifisert driftsområde ved å ikke la den bli utsatt for høy fuktighet og svært høye 
og lave temperaturer. 
• La det være minst 10,2 cm klaring på alle sider av datamaskinen der det er ventilasjonsåpninger, for at luftstrømningen for 
ventilasjon skal bli så høy som nødvendig. 
• Ikke hindre luftstrømningen gjennom utstyret ved å blokkere luftinntak eller ventilasjonsåpninger. 
  OBS! Når strømforsyningen klargjøres for reise, vikle begge kablene rundt strømforsyningen i samme retning, slik som vist på 
følgende bilde. Dersom kablene ikke vikles i riktig retning, kan dette resultere i skade på kablene som ikke dekkes av garantien 
for strømforsyningen. Bruk aldri en strømforsyning som viser tegn til skade eller overdreven slitasje.

Installasjonsveiledning for mediabase 147
Beskyttelse mot elektrostatisk utladning
Elektrostatisk utladning (ESD) kan gjøre skade på elektroniske komponenter inni datamaskinen. Under visse forhold kan det på 
kroppen din eller på en gjenstand, f.eks. et periferiutstyr, dannes en elektrostatisk ladning som deretter utlades til en annen gjenstand, 
f.eks. datamaskinen. For å hindre skade forårsaket av slik utladning, utlad elektrostatisk ladning fra kroppen før du kommer i kontakt 
med noen av komponentene inni datamaskinen, slik som en minnemodul. Du kan hindre skadelig elektrostatisk utladning ved 
å berøre en jordet gjenstand (slik som en umalt flate på datamaskinens I/O-panel) før du kommer i kontakt med elektroniske 
komponenter. Når du skal kople et periferiutstyr (inklusive en håndholdt digital assistent) til datamaskinen, la elektrostatisk ladning 
både fra deg selv og periferiutstyret bli utladet til jord før periferiutstyret tilkoples. Dersom du foretar arbeid inni datamaskinen, berør 
fra tid til annen en I/O-kontakt for å fjerne eventuell opparbeidet elektrostatisk ladning.
Du kan også gjøre følgende for å hindre skade som skyldes elektrostatisk utladning:
• Når du pakker ut fra emballasjen en komponent som er følsom for statisk elektrisitet, ikke fjern komponenten fra det 
antistatiske pakkematerialet før du er klar til å installere komponenten. Like før komponenten skilles fra det elektrostatiske 
pakkematerialet, utlad elektrostatisk ladning fra kroppen.
• Når en følsom komponent skal transporteres, plasser den først i en antistatisk pose eller et antistatisk pakkemateriale.
• Håndter alle komponenter som er følsomme for statisk elektrisitet på et sted som er sikret mot statisk elektrisitet. Hvis 
mulig, bruk gulvmatter og benkmatter som er antistatiske.

Offentlige bestemmelser
Elektromagnetisk interferens (EMI) er ethvert signal eller enhver emisjon, utstrålt i fritt rom eller ledet langs kraft- og signalkabler, 
som setter i fare funksjoneringen til radionavigasjonsutstyr eller annen sikkerhetstjeneste, eller som i alvorlig grad degraderer, 
hindrer eller gjentatt avbryter en lisensiert radiokommunikasjonstjeneste. Radiokommunikasjonstjenester omfatter, men er ikke 
begrenset til: AM/FM-kringkasting, fjernsyn, mobilradiotjenester, radar, luftfartskontroll, personsøkertjenester og private 
radiotjenester. Disse lisensierte tjenestene, med tillegg av kilder for utilsiktet emisjon, slik som digitalt utstyr, inklusive 
datamaskinsystemer, bidrar til det elektromagnetiske miljøet.
Elektromagnetisk kompatibilitet (EMC) er egenskapene elektronisk utstyr har for å fungere sammen på riktig måte i det elektroniske 
miljøet. Selv om denne datamaskinen er blitt utviklet for, og er blitt fastslått samsvarer med, offentlige fastsatte grenser for EMI, er 
dette ingen garanti for at interferens ikke vil forekomme i en bestemt installasjon. Hvis dette utstyret forårsaker interferens med 
radiokommunikasjonstjenester, noe som kan fastslås ved å skru utstyret av og på, oppfordres du til å prøve å fjerne interferensen på en 
av følgende måter:
• Drei mottakerantennen til en annen retning.
• Plasser datamaskinen et annet sted i forhold til mottakeren.
• Flytt datamaskinen lengre vekk fra mottakeren.
• Kople datamaskinens strømforsyning til en nettkontakt som er på en annen strømkurs enn den mottakeren er tilkoplet.

BEPIECZEŃSTWO: Zasady bezpieczeństwa dotyczące zasilania
• Jeżeli produkt jest wyposażony w 3-żyłowy przewód zasilający, należy koniecznie przyłączać go do prawidłowo uziemionego 
źródła zasilania, aby zapobiec porażeniu prądem elektrycznym. Nie stosować rozdzielaczy, ani nie usuwać styku uziemienia 
z wtyczki przewodu zasilającego. Korzystając z przedłużacza należy zastosować przedłużacz takiego typu, który pasuje do 
wtyczki przewodu zasilacza. 
• Używając przedłużacza wraz z zasilaczem prądu zmiennego, należy zadbać, aby całkowity prąd znamionowy urządzeń przyłączonych 
do przedłużacza nie przekraczał prądu znamionowego przedłużacza.
• Używać tylko zasilacza prądu zmiennego dostarczonego przez firmę Dell, zatwierdzonego do stosowania wraz z tym urządzeniem. 
Używanie innego zasilacza może być przyczyną pożaru lub eksplozji. Elektryczne parametry znamionowe zasilacza prądu 
zmiennego można znaleźć w Przewodniku u
żytkownika lub Podręczniku właściciela. 
• Używając listwy zasilającej z wieloma gniazdami należy zachować ostrożność przyłączając przewód zasilacza prądu zmiennego 
do listwy. W przypadku niektórych listw zasilających możliwe jest nieprawidłowe włożenie wtyczki. Skutkiem nieprawidłowego 
włożenia wtyczki zasilacza może być trwałe uszkodzenie urządzenia, a także wystąpienie zagrożenia porażeniem elektrycznym 
i/lub pożarem. Należy zadbać, aby styk uziemienia wtyczki trafił na odpowiedni styk uziemienia gniazda listwy zasilającej.
• Przed przyłączeniem urządzenia do gniazdka elektrycznego należy sprawdzić, czy parametry znamionowe napięcia zasilacza 
prądu zmiennego odpowiadają znamionowemu napięciu i częstotliwości dostępnego źródła zasilania. 
• W celu usunięcia z komputera wszystkich źródeł zasilania należy wyłączy
ć komputer, odłączyć zasilacz prądu zmiennego od 
gniazdka elektrycznego oraz wyjąć wszystkie akumulatory zainstalowane we wnęce akumulatora oraz we wnęce modułów. 
• Kiedy zasilacz prądu zmiennego jest używany do zasilania komputera lub ładowania akumulatora, umieszczać go w przewietrzanym 
miejscu, na przykład na biurku lub na podłodze, Nie przykrywać zasilacza papierami ani innymi przedmiotami, które osłabiałyby 
chłodzenie; nie używać zasilacza znajdującego się w walizce do przenoszenia komputera. 
• Podczas normalnej pracy komputera zasilacz prądu zmiennego może stać się gorący. Zachować ostrożność operując zasilaczem 
podczas i zaraz po pracy. 
• Norwegia i Szwecja: Kabel zasilający przyłączać tylko do gniazdka elektrycznego z uziemieniem. 
• Tylko Japonia: Z zasilaczem prądu zmiennego stosować tylko kabel zasilający prądu przemiennego dostarczony przez firmę 
Dell. Skutkiem używania innego kabla zasilającego może być uszkodzenie urządzenia lub zasilacza prądu zmiennego albo 
wystąpienie zagrożenia pożarem b
ądź porażeniem elektrycznym.
Zalecenia dotyczące ochrony sprzętu
Stosować się do poniższych wytycznych bezpiecznego posługiwania się, aby zapobiec uszkodzeniu sprzętu:
  OSTRZEŻENIE: Przenosząc komputer z otoczenia o niskiej temperaturze do miejsca o wyższej temperaturze 
albo ze środowiska o wysokiej temperaturze do chłodniejszego miejsca, w celu uniknięcia uszkodzenia komputera 
należy zapewnić możliwość aklimatyzacji komputera w temperaturze pokojowej oraz umożliwić odparowanie wilgoci 
przed włączeniem komputera. 
• Chronić komputer przed takimi zagrożeniami ze strony otoczenia, jak brud, pył, żywność, płyny, skrajne temperatury oraz 
wystawienie na nadmierne działanie promieni słonecznych.
• Aby zapewnić pracę komputera w określonych warunkach roboczych, należy unikać miejsc o bezpośrednim lub nadmiernym 
działaniu wilgoci oraz skrajnie wysokich lub niskich temperatur.
• Pozostawiać odstęp minimalny 10,2 cm (4 cale) od wszystkich wentylowanych boków urządzenia, aby zapewnić przepływ 
powietrza niezbędny dla zachowania prawidłowej wentylacji.
• Nie ograniczać przepływu powietrza do urządzenia poprzez blokowanie jakichkolwiek szczelin wentylacyjnych lub dopływów powietrza.

Przewodnik instalacji stacji bazowej Media Base 169
  PRZESTROGA: Przygotowując zasilacz prądu zmiennego do podróży, owinąć oba przewody wokół 
zasilacza w tym samym kierunku, jak to przedstawiono na poniższej ilustracji. Skutkiem zaniedbania 
owinięcia przewodów w prawidłowym kierunku może być uszkodzenie przewodów, które nie jest objęte 
gwarancją udzielaną na zasilacz. Nigdy nie należy używać zasilacza prądu zmiennego, który wykazuje 
objawy uszkodzenia lub nadmiernego zużycia. 
Ochrona przed wyładowaniami elektrostatycznymi
Wyładowania elektrostatyczne (ESD) mogą zaszkodzić częściom elektronicznym wewnątrz komputera. W pewnych warunkach ładunek 
elektrostatyczny może utworzyć się na ciele użytkownika lub na jakimś przedmiocie, na przykład na urządzeniu peryferyjnym, a następnie 
rozładować się do innego przedmiotu, na przykład do komputera. Aby zapobiegać uszkodzeniom spowodowanym przez ładunki 
elektrostatyczne, należy rozładowywać elektryczność statyczną ze swojego ciała przed dotknięciem jakiejkolwiek wewnętrznej części 
elektronicznej komputera, na przykład modułu pamięci. Można ochronić się przed wyładowaniami elektrostatycznymi dotykając 
uziemionego, metalowego przedmiotu (na przykład niemalowanej, metalowej powierzchni panelu wejścia/wyjścia komputera) przed 
dotknięciem jakiejkolwiek części elektronicznej. Przed przyłączeniem urządzenia peryferyjnego (w tym także podręcznych asystentów 
cyfrowych) do komputera należy zawsze uziemiać zarówno samego siebie, jak i to urządzenie peryferyjne. Ponadto, pracując wewnątrz 
komputera, okresowo dotykać złącza wejścia/wyjścia w celu usunię
cia ładunku statycznego, jaki mógł zgromadzić się na własnym ciele.
Aby zapobiec uszkodzeniom powodowanym przez wyładowania elektrostatyczne, można również podejmować następujące środki:
• Rozpakowując część wrażliwą na ładunek elektrostatyczny z opakowania transportowego, nie wyjmuj takiej części z antystatycznego 
materiału opakowania, dopóki nie będziesz gotowy do zainstalowania tej części. Tuż przed zdjęciem opakowania antystatycznego 
powinieneś rozładować elektryczność statyczną ze swojego ciała.
• Transportując wrażliwą część, najpierw umieść ją w antystatycznym pojemniku lub opakowaniu.
• Wszystkimi częściami wrażliwymi na elektryczność statyczną należy operować w miejscu zabezpieczonym przed elektrycznością 
statyczną. Jeżeli to możliwe, stosuj antystatyczne maty na podłodze oraz maty na stole warsztatowym.

безопасности
Следуйте этим инструкциям по технике безопасности в целях обеспечения собственной безопасности и во избежание возможного 
повреждения устройства (компьютера, репликатора портов, стыковочной станции и аналогичных устройств) и рабочего места.
ТЕХНИКА БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ. Общие правила техники безопасности
В целях обеспечения собственной безопасности соблюдайте во время работы нижеуказанные рекомендации.
• При подготовке устройства к работе устанавливайте его на ровную поверхность.
• Не пытайтесь выполнять сервисное обслуживание устройства самостоятельно, за исключением тех случаев, которые 
описаны в документации по оборудованию Dell™ или в инструкциях, предоставленных вам корпорацией Dell. 
Неукоснительно соблюдайте инструкции по установке и
 сервисному обслуживанию.
• Во избежание возможного поражения электрическим током не следует подсоединять или отсоединять какие-либо 
кабели, проводить техническое обслуживание или изменять конфигурацию данного изделия во время грозы. 
Пользоваться стыковочной станцией Media Base во время грозы можно только в том случае, если от нее отсоединены 
все кабели и компьютер работает от аккумулятора.
•
Если в состав устройства входит встроенный или дополнительный (PC Card) модем, то при приближении грозы 
необходимо отсоединить кабель модема, чтобы избежать возможного риска поражения электрическим током в случае 
разряда молнии в телефонную линию.
• Не вставляйте никакие посторонние предметы в вентиляционные отверстия или иные отверстия, предусмотренные 
в корпусе устройства. В противном случае может 
произойти возгорание или поражение электрическим током 
в результате короткого замыкания внутренних компонентов.
• Не устанавливайте устройство рядом с батареями отопления и иными источниками тепла. Кроме того, не следует 
загораживать отверстия, предусмотренные для охлаждения устройства. Не подкладывайте под устройство неплотную 
бумагу; не ставьте устройство в стенной шкаф с закрытой задней стенкой, а 
также на кровать, диван или ковер.
• Не пользуйтесь устройством в условиях повышенной влажности (например, рядом с ванной, раковиной или бассейном, 
или в сыром подвале).
• Не допускайте попадания пищи или жидкостей на компьютер.
• Прежде чем производить чистку устройства, отсоедините устройство от электросети. Чистить устройство следует 
мягкой влажной тканью. Не следует 
пользоваться жидкими или аэрозольными чистящими средствами, в которых могут 
содержаться воспламеняющиеся вещества.
• Убедите сь, что кабель питания адаптера переменного тока не придавлен какими-либо посторонними предметами, 
и уложите его там, где о него не споткнутся и где на него не наступят.
• Не держите работающий компьютер в местах с недостаточной вентиляцией, например
 в сумке для переноски или 
в закрытом кейсе. Это может повредить компьютер или привести к пожару. 
• Не допускайте, чтобы основание работающего портативного компьютера в течение длительного времени касалось 
обнаженной кожи. Температура поверхности основания повышается во время нормальной работы (особенно при 
питании от сети переменного тока). Длительный контакт с обнаженной кожей
 может вызвать неприятные ощущения 
и, в конечном итоге, ожог.
• Платы PC Card могут сильно нагреваться в процессе нормальной работы. Соблюдайте осторожность при извлечении 
плат PC Card после их длительной работы.

ТЕХНИКА БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ. Техника электробезопасности
• Если к данному изделия прилагается кабель питания с 3-штыревым штепселем, его следует подсоединять к источнику 
питания с надлежащим заземлением во избежание возможного поражения электрическим током. Не пользуйтесь 
штепселями-переходниками и не удаляйте штырь заземления из штепселя кабеля питания. Если вы пользуетесь 
удлинительным кабелем питания, следует использовать кабель соответствующего типа, который 
сопрягается со 
штепселем кабеля питания адаптера. 
• Если вы подключаете адаптер переменного тока с помощью удлинительного кабеля питания, убедитесь, что общий 
номинальный ток изделий, подключенных к удлинительному кабелю питания, не превышает номинальный ток 
удлинительного кабеля.
• Используйте только адаптер переменного тока, предоставленный корпорацией Dell и одобренный для применения 
с данным устройством. Использование другого
 адаптера переменного тока может стать причиной пожара или взрыва. 
Требования к электрическим параметрам адаптера переменного тока смотрите в «Руководстве пользователя» или 
«Руководстве по эксплуатации». 
• Если используется сетевой фильтр с несколькими розетками, следует соблюдать осторожность при подсоединении 
кабеля питания адаптера переменного тока к сетевому фильтру. В некоторых сетевых фильтрах отсутствует 
защита от 
неправильного подключения. Неправильное подключение штепселя кабеля питания может привести к неустраняемому 
повреждению устройства, а также создать риск поражения электрическим током или возникновения пожара. Убедитесь, 
что заземляющий плоский контакт штепселя кабеля питания вставлен в соответствующий заземляющий разъем 
сетевого фильтра.
• Перед подключением устройства к электросети проверьте номинальное напряжение адаптера переменного 
тока, чтобы 
убедиться в том, что требуемые напряжение и частота оответствуют имеющемуся источнику питания. 
• Чтобы отключить компьютер от всех источников питания, выключите компьютер, отсоедините адаптер переменного 
тока от электросети и выньте все аккумуляторы, установленные в акумуляторном отсеке или модульном отсеке. 
• Если вы используете адаптер переменного тока для обеспечения работы компьютера
 или для подзарядки аккумулятора, 
установите его в хорошо вентилируемом месте (например, на столе или на полу). Не накрывайте адаптер переменного 
тока бумагами или другими предметами, которые приведут к ухудшению его охлаждения; также не следует использовать 
адаптер переменного тока внутри сумки для переноски. 
• Адаптер переменного тока может сильно нагреваться в процессе
 нормальной работы компьютера. Соблюдайте 
осторожность при обращении с адаптером во время работы или сразу после ее завершения. 
• Норвегия и Швеция. Подсоединяйте кабель питания только к электрической розетке с заземлением. 
• Только в Японии. Используйте с адаптером переменного тока только сетевой кабель питания, предоставленный 
корпорацией Dell. Использование любого другого кабеля питания 
может привести к повреждению устройства или 
адаптера переменного тока, или может стать причиной пожара или поражения электрическим током.

Руководство по установке стыковочной станции Media Base 191
Инструкции по защите оборудования
Во избежание повреждения оборудования соблюдайте во время работы нижеуказанные рекомендации.
  ЗАМЕЧАНИЕ. Если компьютер попадает из низкотемпературной среды в среду с более высокой 
температурой, или наоборот, дайте ему акклиматизироваться до комнатной температуры и дождитесь, 
чтобы испарился любой образовавшийся конденсат. Тольк о после этого можно будет включить питание. 
Это поможет избежать повреждения компьютера. 
• Оберегайте устройство от опасных воздействий окружающей среды (например, грязь, пыль, пищевые 
продукты, 
жидкости, экстремальные температуры и чрезмерное воздействие солнечных лучей). 
• Оберегайте устройство от прямого попадания влаги или от чрезмерной влажности, а также от воздействия чрезмерно 
высоких или низких температур, чтобы обеспечить использование компьютера в пределах указанного рабочего диапазона. 
• Обеспечьте зазор не менее 10,2 см со всех сторон устройства, в которых имеются вентиляционные
 отверстия, чтобы 
обеспечить приток воздуха, необходимый для надлежащей вентиляции. 
• Не загораживайте вентиляционные отверстия и воздухозаборники, чтобы не ограничивать приток воздуха в устройство. 
  ПРЕДУПРЕЖДЕНИЕ. При подготовке адаптера переменного тока к поездке следует обернуть оба шнура 
вокруг адаптера в одном и том же направлении, как показано на следующем рисунке. Если не обернуть шнуры 
в правильном направлении, может произойти их повреждение, на которое не распространяется действие 
гарантии в отношении адаптера. Не разрешается использовать адаптер переменного тока при
 наличии 
признаков повреждения или чрезмерного износа.

192 Руководство по установке стыковочной станции Media Base
Защита от электростатического разряда
Электростатические разряды могут повредить внутренние электронные компоненты компьютера. В определенных условиях 
на вашем теле или на каком-либо предмете (например, на периферийном устройстве) может накапливаться электростатический 
заряд, который затем может разрядиться на другой предмет (например, на компьютер). Во избежание повреждения 
оборудования в результате электростатического разряда следует снимать статическое электричество с тела
 перед тем, 
как прикасаться к любым внутренним электронным компонентам компьютера (например, к модулю памяти). Защиту от 
электростатического разряда можно обеспечить, прикоснувшись к металлическому заземленному предмету (например, 
к неокрашенной металлической поверхности панели ввода-вывода на компьютере) перед работой с любыми электронными 
компонентами. При подключении к компьютеру периферийного устройства (включая карманные персональные 
компьютеры) 
необходимо обязательно заземлиться самому и заземлить периферийное устройство перед его подключением к компьютеру. 
Кроме того, во время работы с внутренними компонентами компьютера необходимо периодически прикасаться к разъему 
ввода-вывода, чтобы снять с тела любой накопившийся статический заряд.
Во избежание повреждения в результате электростатического разряда можно также выполнить следующие действия.
•
При извлечении статически чувствительных компонентов из транспортной картонной коробки не следует вынимать 
компонент из антистатической упаковки до тех пор, пока вы не будете готовы к его установки в компьютер. Перед тем, 
как развернуть антистатическую упаковку, обязательно снимите статическое электричество с тела.
• При перевозке чувствительного компонента его необходимо сначала поместить в 
антистатический контейнер или 
в антистатическю упаковку.
• Работать со всеми электростатически чувствительными компонентами следует в местах, защищенных от накопления 
статических зарядов. Если возможно, используйте антистатические напольные прокладки и прокладки под ножки 
рабочих столов.

Media Base Installationsguide 211
VARNING! Säkerhetsanvisningar
Använd följande säkerhetsriktlinjer för att garantera din personliga säkerhet och för att hjälpa dig att skydda din enhet (dator, 
portreplikator, Media Base, dockningsenhet eller liknande enheter).
SÄKERHET: Allmän säkerhet
Observera följande säkerhetsriktlinjer för att garantera personlig säkerhet:
• Placera enheten på en vågrät yta när du installerar den för användning.
• Försök inte själv göra service på enheten, utom för de fall som förklaras i Dell™-dokumentationen eller i andra anvisningar 
som Dell tillhandahållit. Följ alltid installations- och serviceanvisningarna noggrant.
• Koppla inte i eller ur några kablar, och utför inte service eller konfiguration under åskväder för att undvika eventuell risk för 
elstöt. Använd inte Media Base vid åskväder, såvida inte alla kablar kopplats från och datorn körs på batteri.
• Om din enhet har ett integrerat eller externt (PC Card) modem ska du koppla från modemkabeln om ett åskväder förväntas 
för att undvika risken för elstöt från blixtnedslag i telefonledningen.
• Tryck inte in några föremål i ventilationsöppningarna på din enhet. Detta kan orsaka eldsvåda eller elstöt genom kortslutning 
av interna komponenter.
• Håll din enhet borta från radiatorer och värmekällor. Blockera inte heller ventilationsöppningarna. Undvik att placera lösa 
papper under din enhet, placera inte enheten i ett stängt utrymme eller på en säng, soffa eller matta. 
• Använd inte enheten i en våt miljö, t.ex. nära ett badkar, en vask eller en simbassäng eller i en våt källare.
• Spill inte mat eller vätskor på datorn.
• Koppla alltid ur enheten från eluttaget innan du rengör den. Rengör enheten med en mjuk trasa fuktad med vatten. Använd 
inte rengöringsvätskor eller aerosolspray som kan innehålla antändliga ämnen.
• Kontrollera att inget vilar på kabeln till nätadaptern och att kabeln inte är placerad så att någon kan snubbla eller trampa 
på den.
• Låt inte datorn vara igång där luftcirkulationen är dålig, till exempel i en väska eller stängd portfölj. Om luftcirkulationen 
hindras kan datorn skadas eller orsaka brand. 
• Låt inte din bärbara dator vara igång längre perioder om den vilar mot bar hud. Yttertemperaturen på datorns undersida 
stiger vid normal användning (särskilt om en nätadapter används). Kontakt med bar hud under längre tid kan orsaka obehag 
eller till och med brännskador.
• PC Card-enheter kan bli mycket varma vid normal användning. Iaktta försiktighet när du tar ut PC Card-enheter som använts. 
• Denna enhet kan innehålla optiska drivenheter (Optical Disk Drives, ODD), cd-rom, cdr/w, dvd osv., som har inbyggda 
laserenheter. Sådana optiska drivenheter följer säkerhetsbestämmelserna och klassificeras som ”Laserprodukter klass 1” 
enligt standarderna US DHHS Standard och EN/IEC60825-1 Laser Safety Standard. Dessa optiska drivenheter innehåller 
inga delar som användaren kan justera eller göra service på. För att förhindra risk för exponering för laserstrålning ska du inte 
öppna eller inaktivera säkerhetsmekanismen i den optiska enheten.

212 Media Base Installationsguide
SÄKERHET: Elsäkerhet
• Om denna produkt levereras med en nätkabel med tre kontakter måste den anslutas till en strömkälla som är ordentligt 
jordad, för att undvika elstötar. Använd inte kontaktadaptrar och ta inte bort jordkontakten från nätkontakten. Om du 
använder en förlängningskabel ska du kontrollera att du använder rätt sorts kabel som passar med rätt kontakt. 
• Om du använder en förlängningskabel till din nätadapter ska du kontrollera att den totala strömmen till de produkter du 
anslutit via förlängningskabeln inte överstiger kabelns märkström.
• Använd endast den nätadapter som Dell tillhandahåller och som är godkänd för användning med enheten. Användning av en 
annan nätadapter kan orsaka brand eller explosion. Se användarhandboken eller ägarhandboken för information om 
nätadapterns elektriska specifikationer. 
• Om du använder en förgreningsdosa med flera uttag ska du vara försiktig när du kopplar in nätadptern i förgreningsdosan. 
Vissa förgreningsdosor kan tillåta att du kopplar i kontakten på fel sätt. Felaktig inkoppling av nätkontakten kan orsaka 
bestående skada på enheten och risk för elstöt eller brand. Kontrollera att jordstiftet på nätkontakten är inkopplat 
i jordningshylsan på förgreningsdosan.
• Innan du ansluter enheten till ett eluttag ska du kontrollera att spänning och frekvens stämmer överens med det elnät du ska 
koppla till. 
• Koppla bort datorn från alla strömkällor och stäng av den, koppla från nätadaptern från eluttaget och ta bort alla batterier 
som är installerade i batterifacket eller modulfacket. 
• Placera nätadaptern på en plats med luftcirkulation såsom ett skrivbord, eller på golvet när du använder den för att driva 
datorn eller ladda batteriet. Täck inte över nätadaptern med papper eller andra föremål som kan försämra kylningen. Använd 
inte heller nätadaptern inuti en väska. 
• Nätadaptern kan bli varm vid normal drift med datorn. Iaktta försiktighet när du hanterar adaptern vid eller omedelbart efter 
drift. 
• Norge och Sverige: Anslut endast nätkabeln till ett jordat uttag. 
• Endast Japan: Använd endast den nätkabel som Dell tillhandahåller med nätadaptern. Användning av en annan nätkabel 
kan skada enheten eller nätadaptern eller ge upphov till risk för eldsvåda eller elstöt.
Skyddsinstruktioner för utrustning
Iaktta följande säkerhetsriktlinjer för att förhindra skada på din utrustning:
  ANMÄRKNING: När du flyttar datorn från en plats med låg temperatur till en varmare miljö eller från en plats med hög 
temperatur till en svalare miljö ska du, för att undvika skada, låta datorn anpassa sig till rumstemperatur och låta eventuell 
kondens som bildats avdunsta innan datorn sätts igång. 
• Skydda enheten från miljöfaror såsom smuts, damm, mat, vätskor, extrema temperaturer och solljus.
• Undvik att enheten utsätts för väta eller hög fuktnivå och extremt varma eller kalla temperaturer för att garantera att datorn 
används i specificerad driftsmiljö. 
• Lämna ett avstånd på minst 10,2 cm (4 tum) på alla sidor med ventilationsöppningar för att tillåta den luftcirkulation 
som krävs. 
• Begränsa inte luftcirkulationen för enheten genom att blockera ventilationsöppningar eller luftintag. 
  VARNING! När du förbereder nätadaptern för resor ska du linda båda ledningarna runt adaptern på det håll som visas på 
bilden nedan. Om kablarna inte lindas på rätt håll kan skada uppstå på dem som inte täcks av adapterns garanti. Använd aldrig 
en nätadapter som visar tecken på skada eller slitage.

Media Base Installationsguide 213
Skydd mot elektrostatisk urladdning
Elektrostatiska urladdningar (Electrostatic Discharge, ESD) kan skada elektroniska komponenter i datorn. Under vissa förhållanden 
kan statisk elektricitet bildas på kroppen eller ett föremål, t.ex. ett tillbehör, för att sedan urladdas i ett annat föremål, exempelvis 
din dator. För att förebygga skador från elektrostatiska urladdningar, bör du ladda ur statisk elektricitet från din kropp innan du rör 
någon elektronisk komponent till datorn, exempelvis en minnesmodul. Du kan skydda mot elektrostatisk urladdning genom att 
röra vid ett jordat metallobjekt (till exempel en omålad metallyta på datorns I/O-panel) innan du rör vid någon elektronik. När du 
ansluter ett tillbehör (inklusive handdatorer) till datorn bör du alltid jorda dig och tillbehöret innan du ansluter det till datorn. Om 
du arbetar inuti datorn ska du dessutom röra vid I/O-kontakten då och då för att avlägsna eventuell statisk elektricitet i kroppen.
Du kan även göra följande för att förhindra skador på grund av statisk elektricitet:
• Ta inte ut en komponent som är känslig för statisk elektricitet från förpackningen förrän du är redo att installera den. Ladda 
ur statisk elektricitet i din kropp precis innan du öppnar den antistatiska förpackningen.
• Placera en känslig komponent i en antistatisk förpackning innan den transporteras.
• Hantera alla komponenter som är känsliga för statisk elektricitet på en plats med antistatiska hjälpmedel. Använd om möjligt 
antistatiska golvmattor och arbetsbordsunderlägg.

Information om lagkrav
EMI (Electromagnetic Interference [Elektromagnetisk störning]) är de signaler eller emissioner som utstrålas i fria utrymmen eller 
leds utmed kraft- eller signalkablar och som hotar funktionen i radionavigerings- eller andra säkerhetsmässiga tjänster, eller allvarligt 
försämrar, hindrar eller upprepade gånger avbryter en licensierad radiokommunikationstjänst. Radiokommunikationstjänster 
innefattar, men begränsas ej till, kommersiella AM/FM-utsändningar, television, mobiltelefoni, radar, flygledning, PCS (Personal 
Communication Services [Personsökare och digitala kommunikationstjänster (GSM)]). Dessa licensierade tjänster, tillsammans med 
oavsiktliga strålningsenheter, t.ex. digitala enheter, inklusive datorsystem, bidrar till den elektromagnetiska miljön.
EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility [Elektromagnetisk kompatibilitet]) är den elektriska utrustningens förmåga att fungera ihop 
på ett riktigt sätt i den elektromagnetiska miljön. Även om den här datorn har utformats och är kompatibelt med gränsvärdena för 
EMI, lämnas inga garantier för att störningar inte kan uppstå vid en viss installation. Om denna utrustning trots allt orsakar 
störningar i radiokommunikationstjänsten, vilket kan påvisas genom att utrustningen kopplas av och på, bör du försöka åtgärda 
störningen genom att vidta en eller flera av följande åtgärder:
• Rikta om den mottagande antennen.
• Placera om datorn i förhållande till mottagaren.
• Flytta bort datorn från mottagaren.
• Ansluta datorn till ett annat strömuttag så att datorn och mottagaren ligger på olika kretsgrenar.
Om det behövs tar du kontakt med supporten hos Dell eller en kunnig radio-/tv-tekniker för ytterligare förslag på åtgärder. 
Se användarhandboken eller ägarhandboken för ytterligare information om bestämmelser.
Dell™-produkter är utformade, testade och klassificerade för sina tilltänkta elektromagnetiska miljöer. Med dessa elektromagnetiska 
miljöklassificeringar menas vanligen följande definitioner:
• Klass A är vanligt för kontorsmiljö eller industriell miljö. Klass B-produkter kan också användas i en klass A-miljö. 
• Klass B är vanligt för bostadsområden. Klass A-produkter bör inte användas i en klass B-miljö. 
ITE (Information Technology Equipment), inklusive kringutrustning, tilläggskort, skrivare, in-/utdataenheter (I/O), bildskärmar 
och så vidare som är integrerade i eller anslutna till datorn, bör matcha datorns elektromagnetiska miljöklassificering.
En anmärkning om skärmade signalkablar: Använd endast avskärmade kablar när du ansluter enheter till Dell-enheter för att 
minska risken för störningar med radiokommunikationstjänster. Genom att använda avskärmade signalkablar försäkrar du dig 
om att lämplig elektromagnetisk kompatibilitetsklassificering bibehålls för den avsedda miljön. För parallellanslutna skrivare 
finns kabel att tillgå från Dell. Om du vill kan du beställa en kabel från Dell på Internet, www.dell.com. 
Dell har funnit att denna produkt överensstämmer med klass B. Följande avsnitt ger EMC/EMI- eller produktsäkerhetsinformation 
som är specifik för varje land. 
Du finner ytterligare information om gällande bestämmelser i ”Regulatory Notices” på sidan 21.
