1.5 Design Overview
This section presents a design overview of key parts and features 
of the computer. Refer to Chapter 3, “Illustrated Parts Catalog,” 
to identify replacement parts, and Chapter 5, “Removal and 
Replacement Procedures,” for disassembly steps.
The system board provides the following device connections:
■ Memory module
■ Mini PCI communications devices
■ Hard drive
■ Display
■ Keyboard and TouchPad
■ Audio
■ Intel Pentium M and Celeron M processors
■ Fan
■ PC Card
Ä
CAUTION: To properly ventilate the computer, allow at least a 7.6-cm 
(3-inch) clearance on the left and right sides of the computer.
The computer uses an electric fan for ventilation. The fan is 
controlled by a temperature sensor and is designed to be turned 
on automatically when high temperature conditions exist. These 
conditions are affected by high external temperatures, system 
power consumption, power management/battery conservation 
configurations, battery fast charging, and software applications. 
Exhaust air is displaced through the ventilation grill located on 
the left side of the computer.

Removal and Replacement
Preliminaries
This chapter provides essential information for proper and 
safe removal and replacement service.
4.1 Tools Required
You will need the following tools to complete the removal and 
replacement procedures:
■ Magnetic screwdriver
■ Phillips P0 screwdriver
■ 5.0-mm socket for system board screwlocks
■ Flat-bladed screwdriver
■ Tool kit—includes connector removal tool, loopback plugs, 
and case utility tool
4.2 Service Considerations
The following sections include some of the considerations 
that you should keep in mind during disassembly and assembly 
procedures.
✎
As you remove each subassembly from the computer, place 
the subassembly (and all accompanying screws) away from 
the work area to prevent damage.

--- Page 106 ---
4–2 Maintenance and Service Guide
Removal and Replacement Preliminaries
Plastic Parts
Using excessive force during disassembly and reassembly can 
damage plastic parts. Use care when handling the plastic parts. 
Apply pressure only at the points designated in the maintenance 
instructions.
Cables and Connectors
Ä
CAUTION: When servicing the computer, ensure that cables are 
placed in their proper locations during the reassembly process. 
Improper cable placement can damage the computer.
Cables must be handled with extreme care to avoid damage. 
Apply only the tension required to unseat or seat the cables 
during removal and insertion. Handle cables by the connector 
whenever possible. In all cases, avoid bending, twisting, or 
tearing cables. Ensure that cables are routed in such a way that 
they cannot be caught or snagged by parts being removed or 
replaced. Handle flex cables with extreme care; these cables 
tear easily.
4.3 Preventing Damage to 
Removable Drives
Removable drives are fragile components that must be handled 
with care. To prevent damage to the computer, damage to a 
removable drive, or loss of information, observe the following 
precautions:
■ Before removing or inserting a hard drive, shut down the 
computer. If you are unsure whether the computer is off or 
in Hibernation, turn the computer on, and then shut it down 
through the operating system.
■ Before removing a diskette drive or optical drive, ensure that 
a diskette or disc is not in the drive and ensure that the optical 
drive tray is closed.

--- Page 107 ---
Removal and Replacement Preliminaries
Maintenance and Service Guide 4–3
■ Before handling a drive, ensure that you are discharged of 
static electricity. While handling a drive, avoid touching the 
connector.
■ Handle drives on surfaces covered with at least one inch of 
shock-proof foam.
■ Avoid dropping drives from any height onto any surface.
■ After removing a hard drive, CD-ROM drive, or a diskette 
drive, place it in a static-proof bag.
■ Avoid exposing a hard drive to products that have magnetic 
fields, such as monitors or speakers.
■ Avoid exposing a drive to temperature extremes or liquids.
■ If a drive must be mailed, place the drive in a bubble pack 
mailer or other suitable form of protective packaging and label 
the package, “FRAGILE: Handle With Care.”
4.4 Preventing Electrostatic Damage
Many electronic components are sensitive to electrostatic 
discharge (ESD). Circuitry design and structure determine the 
degree of sensitivity. Networks built into many integrated circuits 
provide some protection, but in many cases, the discharge 
contains enough power to alter device parameters or melt 
silicon junctions.
A sudden discharge of static electricity from a finger or other 
conductor can destroy static-sensitive devices or microcircuitry. 
Often the spark is neither felt nor heard, but damage occurs.
An electronic device exposed to electrostatic discharge might not 
be affected at all and can work perfectly throughout a normal 
cycle. Or the device might function normally for a while, then 
degrade in the internal layers, reducing its life expectancy.

Removal and Replacement Preliminaries
4.5 Packaging and Transporting 
Precautions
Use the following grounding precautions when packaging and 
transporting equipment:
■ To avoid hand contact, transport products in static-safe 
containers, such as tubes, bags, or boxes.
■ Protect all electrostatic-sensitive parts and assemblies with 
conductive or approved containers or packaging.
■ Keep electrostatic-sensitive parts in their containers until 
the parts arrive at static-free workstations.
■ Place items on a grounded surface before removing items 
from their containers.
■ Always be properly grounded when touching a sensitive 
component or assembly.
■ Store reusable electrostatic-sensitive parts from assemblies 
in protective packaging or nonconductive foam.
■ Use transporters and conveyors made of antistatic belts and 
roller bushings. Ensure that mechanized equipment used for 
moving materials is wired to ground and that proper materials 
are selected to avoid static charging. When grounding is not 
possible, use an ionizer to dissipate electric charges.

Maintenance and Service Guide 4–5
4.6 Workstation Precautions
Use the following grounding precautions at workstations:
■ Cover the workstation with approved static-shielding material 
(refer to 
Table 4-2, “Static-Shielding Materials”).
■ Use a wrist strap connected to a properly grounded work 
surface and use properly grounded tools and equipment.
■ Use conductive field service tools, such as cutters, 
screwdrivers, and vacuums.
■ When using fixtures that must directly contact dissipative 
surfaces, only use fixtures made of static-safe materials.
■ Keep the work area free of nonconductive materials, such 
as ordinary plastic assembly aids and Styrofoam.
■ Handle electrostatic-sensitive components, parts, and 
assemblies by the case or PCM laminate. Handle these 
items only at static-free workstations.
■ Avoid contact with pins, leads, or circuitry.
■ Turn off power and input signals before inserting or removing 
connectors or test equipment.

4–6 Maintenance and Service Guide
Removal and Replacement Preliminaries
4.7 Grounding Equipment and 
Methods
Grounding equipment must include either a wrist strap or a 
foot strap at a grounded workstation.
■ When seated, wear a wrist strap connected to a grounded 
system. Wrist straps are flexible straps with a minimum of 
one megohm ±10% resistance in the ground cords. To provide 
proper ground, wear a strap snugly against the skin at all times. 
On grounded mats with banana-plug connectors, use alligator 
clips to connect a wrist strap.
■ When standing, use foot straps and a grounded floor mat. 
Foot straps (heel, toe, or boot straps) can be used at standing 
workstations and are compatible with most types of shoes 
or boots. On conductive floors or dissipative floor mats, use 
foot straps on both feet with a minimum of one megohm 
resistance between the operator and ground. To be effective, 
the conductive strips must be worn in contact with the skin.
Other grounding equipment recommended for use in preventing 
electrostatic damage includes:
■ Antistatic tape
■ Antistatic smocks, aprons, and sleeve protectors
■ Conductive bins and other assembly or soldering aids
■ Nonconductive foam
■ Conductive tabletop workstations with ground cords of 
one megohm resistance
■ Static-dissipative tables or floor mats with hard ties to 
the ground
■ Field service kits
■ Static awareness labels
■ Material-handling packages
■ Nonconductive plastic bags, tubes, or boxes
■ Metal tote boxes
■ Electrostatic voltage levels and protective materials
