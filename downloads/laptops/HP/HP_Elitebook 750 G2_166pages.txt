4 Removal and replacement procedures
preliminary requirements
Tools required
You will need the following tools to complete the removal and replacement procedures:
●
Flat-bladed screwdriver
●
Magnetic screwdriver
●
Phillips P0 and P1 screwdrivers
Service considerations
The following sections include some of the considerations that you must keep in mind during disassembly
and assembly procedures.
NOTE: As you remove each subassembly from the computer, place the subassembly (and all accompanying
screws) away from the work area to prevent damage.
Plastic parts
CAUTION: Using excessive force during disassembly and reassembly can damage plastic parts. Use care
when handling the plastic parts. Apply pressure only at the points designated in
the maintenance instructions.
Cables and connectors
CAUTION: When servicing the computer, be sure that cables are placed in their proper locations during
the reassembly process. Improper cable placement can damage the computer.
Cables must be handled with extreme care to avoid damage. Apply only the tension required to unseat or
seat the cables during removal and insertion. Handle cables by the connector whenever possible. In all cases,
avoid bending, twisting, or tearing cables. Be sure that cables are routed in such a way that they cannot be
caught or snagged by parts being removed or replaced. Handle flex cables with extreme care; these cables
tear easily.
Tools required 47

--- Page 60 ---
Drive handling
CAUTION: Drives are fragile components that must be handled with care. To prevent damage to
the computer, damage to a drive, or loss of information, observe these precautions:
Before removing or inserting a hard drive, shut down the computer. If you are unsure whether the computer
is off or in Hibernation, turn the computer on, and then shut it down through the operating system.
Before handling a drive, be sure that you are discharged of static electricity. While handling a drive, avoid
touching the connector.
Before removing a diskette drive or optical drive, be sure that a diskette or disc is not in the drive and be sure
that the optical drive tray is closed.
Handle drives on surfaces covered with at least one inch of shock-proof foam.
Avoid dropping drives from any height onto any surface.
After removing a hard drive, an optical drive, or a diskette drive, place it in a static-proof bag.
Avoid exposing an internal hard drive to products that have magnetic fields, such as monitors or speakers.
Avoid exposing a drive to temperature extremes or liquids.
If a drive must be mailed, place the drive in a bubble pack mailer or other suitable form of protective
packaging and label the package “FRAGILE.”
Grounding guidelines
Electrostatic discharge damage
Electronic components are sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Circuitry design and structure
determine the degree of sensitivity. Networks built into many integrated circuits provide some protection,
but in many cases, ESD contains enough power to alter device parameters or melt silicon junctions.
A discharge of static electricity from a finger or other conductor can destroy static-sensitive devices or
microcircuitry. Even if the spark is neither felt nor heard, damage may have occurred.
An electronic device exposed to ESD may not be affected at all and can work perfectly throughout a normal
cycle. Or the device may function normally for a while, then degrade in the internal layers, reducing its
life expectancy.
CAUTION: To prevent damage to the computer when you are removing or installing internal components,
observe these precautions:
Keep components in their electrostatic-safe containers until you are ready to install them.
Before touching an electronic component, discharge static electricity by using the guidelines described in this
section.
Avoid touching pins, leads, and circuitry. Handle electronic components as little as possible.
If you remove a component, place it in an electrostatic-safe container.
The following table shows how humidity affects the electrostatic voltage levels generated by
different activities.
CAUTION: A product can be degraded by as little as 700 V.

Packing PCBs in foam-lined box 21,000 V 11,000 V 5,000 V
Packaging and transporting guidelines
Follow these grounding guidelines when packaging and transporting equipment:
●
To avoid hand contact, transport products in static-safe tubes, bags, or boxes.
●
Protect ESD-sensitive parts and assemblies with conductive or approved containers or packaging.
●
Keep ESD-sensitive parts in their containers until the parts arrive at static-free workstations.
●
Place items on a grounded surface before removing items from their containers.
●
Always be properly grounded when touching a component or assembly.
●
Store reusable ESD-sensitive parts from assemblies in protective packaging or nonconductive foam.
●
Use transporters and conveyors made of antistatic belts and roller bushings. Be sure that mechanized
equipment used for moving materials is wired to ground and that proper materials are selected to avoid
static charging. When grounding is not possible, use an ionizer to dissipate electric charges.
Workstation guidelines
Follow these grounding workstation guidelines:
●
Cover the workstation with approved static-shielding material.
●
Use a wrist strap connected to a properly grounded work surface and use properly grounded tools and
equipment.
●
Use conductive field service tools, such as cutters, screwdrivers, and vacuums.
●
When fixtures must directly contact dissipative surfaces, use fixtures made only of static-
safe materials.
●
Keep the work area free of nonconductive materials, such as ordinary plastic assembly aids
and Styrofoam.
●
Handle ESD-sensitive components, parts, and assemblies by the case or PCM laminate. Handle these
items only at static-free workstations.
Grounding guidelines 49

--- Page 62 ---
●
Avoid contact with pins, leads, or circuitry.
●
Turn off power and input signals before inserting or removing connectors or test equipment.
Equipment guidelines
Grounding equipment must include either a wrist strap or a foot strap at a grounded workstation.
●
When seated, wear a wrist strap connected to a grounded system. Wrist straps are flexible straps with a
minimum of one megohm ±10% resistance in the ground cords. To provide proper ground, wear a strap
snugly against the skin at all times. On grounded mats with banana-plug connectors, use alligator clips
to connect a wrist strap.
●
When standing, use foot straps and a grounded floor mat. Foot straps (heel, toe, or boot straps) can be
used at standing workstations and are compatible with most types of shoes or boots. On conductive
floors or dissipative floor mats, use foot straps on both feet with a minimum of one megohm resistance
between the operator and ground. To be effective, the conductive must be worn in contact with
the skin.
The following grounding equipment is recommended to prevent electrostatic damage:
●
Antistatic tape
●
Antistatic smocks, aprons, and sleeve protectors
●
Conductive bins and other assembly or soldering aids
●
Nonconductive foam
●
Conductive tabletop workstations with ground cords of one megohm resistance
●
Static-dissipative tables or floor mats with hard ties to the ground
●
Field service kits
●
Static awareness labels
●
Material-handling packages
●
Nonconductive plastic bags, tubes, or boxes
●
Metal tote boxes
●
Electrostatic voltage levels and protective materials
The following table lists the shielding protection provided by antistatic bags and floor mats.
Material Use Voltage protection level
Antistatic plastics Bags 1,500 V
Carbon-loaded plastic Floor mats 7,500 V
Metallized laminate Floor mats 5,000 V

Using MultiBoot
About the boot device order
As the computer starts, the system attempts to boot from enabled devices. The MultiBoot utility, which is
enabled at the factory, controls the order in which the system selects a boot device. Boot devices can include
optical drives, diskette drives, a network interface card (NIC), hard drives, and USB devices. Boot devices
contain bootable media or files that the computer needs to start and operate properly.
NOTE: Some boot devices must be enabled in Computer Setup before they can be included in the boot
order.
You can change the order in which the computer searches for a boot device by changing the boot order in
Computer Setup. You can also press esc while the “Press the ESC key for Startup Menu” message is displayed
at the bottom of the screen, and then press f9. Pressing f9 displays a menu that shows the current boot
devices and allows you to select a boot device. Or, you can use MultiBoot Express to set the computer to
prompt you for a boot location each time the computer turns on or restarts.
Choosing MultiBoot preferences
You can use MultiBoot in the following ways:
●
To set a new boot order that the computer uses each time it is turned on, by changing the boot order in
Computer Setup.
●
To dynamically choose the boot device, by pressing esc while the “Press the ESC key for Startup Menu”
message is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and then pressing f9 to enter the Boot Device Options
menu.
●
To use MultiBoot Express to set variable boot orders. This feature prompts you for a boot device each
time the computer is turned on or restarted.
Dynamically choosing a boot device using the f9 prompt
To dynamically choose a boot device for the current startup sequence, follow these steps:
1. Open the Select Boot Device menu by turning on or restarting the computer, and then pressing esc while
the “Press the ESC key for Startup Menu” message is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
2. Press f9.
3. Use a pointing device or the arrow keys to select a boot device, then press enter.
Using HP PC Hardware Diagnostics (UEFI) (select models only)
HP PC Hardware Diagnostics is a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) that allows you to run
diagnostic tests to determine if the computer hardware is functioning properly. The tool runs outside of the
operating system to isolate hardware failures from issues that may be caused by the operating system or
other software components.

14 Statement of Volatility
The purpose of this document is to provide general information regarding non-volatile memory in industry-
standards based HP Business Notebook PC systems and provide general instructions for restoring
nonvolatile memory that can contain personal data after the system has been powered off and the hard drive
has been removed.
HP Business Notebook PC products that use Intel®-based or AMD®-based system boards contain volatile DDR
memory. The amount of nonvolatile memory present in the system depends upon the system configuration.
Intel-based and AMD-based system boards contain nonvolatile memory subcomponents as originally
shipped from HP assuming that no subsequent modifications have been made to the system and assuming
that no applications, features, or functionality have been added to or installed on the system.
Following system shutdown and removal of all power sources from an HP Business Notebook PC system,
personal data can remain on volatile system memory (DIMMs) for a finite period of time and will also remain
in nonvolatile memory. The steps below will remove personal data from the notebook PC, including the
nonvolatile memory found in Intel-based and AMD-based system boards. Some of these steps are disclosed
in the Maintenance & Service Guides available for HP PC products available on the product support pages at
www.hp.com.
1. Follow steps (a) through (I) below to restore the nonvolatile memory that can contain personal data.
Restoring or re-programming nonvolatile memory that does not store personal data is neither
necessary nor recommended.
a. Enter BIOS (F10) Setup by powering on the system and pressing F10 when prompted near the
bottom of the display, or press the ESC key to display the start up menu, then press F10 . If the
system has a BIOS administrator password, enter the password at the prompt.
b. Select the File menu, then Restore Defaults.
c. Select the System Configuration menu, then Restore Security Defaults.
d. If an asset or ownership tag is set, select the Security menu and scroll down to the Utilities menu.
Select System IDs, and then select the tag that has been set. Press the spacebar once to clear the
tag, then press Enter to return to the prior menu.
e. If a DriveLock password is set, select the Security menu, select Hard Drive Tools, scroll down to
DriveLock, then select DriveLock password. Select the desired hard drive. Click Disable
protection, enter the existing master DriveLock password, then press Enter to confirm and return
to the prior menu. Repeat this procedure if more than one hard drive has a DriveLock password.
f. If an Automatic DriveLock password is set, select the Security menu, select Hard Drive Tools,
scroll down to Automatic DriveLock, then select the desired hard drive and disable protection.
Repeat this procedure if more than one hard drive has an Automatic DriveLock password.
g. Select the File menu, then Reset BIOS Security to factory default. Click yes at the warning
message.
h. Select the File menu, then Save Changes and Exit.
i. Reboot the system. If the system has a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and/or fingerprint sensor,
one or two prompts will appear. One to clear the TPM and the other to Reset Fingerprint Sensor;
press F1 to accept or F2 to reject.
If the HP notebook model number includes Intel® Centrino with VPro™, reboot the PC and enter
BIOS Setup by pressing F10 when prompted. Select System Configuration, then AMT Options.
143

--- Page 156 ---
Then select Un-configure AMT on next boot. Select Save then Yes. Select the File menu, and then
select Save Changes and Exit. Reboot the system and confirm that you want to un-configure AMT.
j. If the optional Intel® Anti-Theft Technology (AT) was activated, contact the provider to de-activate
it.
k. If the optional Absolute® Software Computrace® management and tracking service was activated
on the notebook PC, contact the provider to deactivate it.
l. Remove all power and system batteries for at least 24 hours.
2. Remove and retain the storage drive or clear the contents of the drive.
a. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
Clear the HDD contents by using the HP Disk Sanitizer® utility or a third party application that,
ideally, is U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) 5220.22-M approved.
To run HP Disk Sanitizer, enter BIOS Setup by powering on the system and pressing F10 when
prompted near the bottom of the display, or press ESC to display the start up menu, then press
F10. Select the Security menu and scroll down to the Utilities menu. Select Disk Sanitizer and
select the desired drive. For a higher level of protection, select Optimum.
NOTE: This process will take a long time, and the amount of time varies based on the hard drive
capacity.
b. Solid State Drive (SSD)
Clear the SSD contents by using the BIOS Setup Secure Erase command option, or by using a third
party utility designed to erase data from an SSD. To run Secure Erase, enter BIOS Setup by
powering on the system and pressing F10 when prompted near the bottom of the display. Select
the Security menu and scroll down to the Utilities menu. Select Secure Erase and select the
desired hard drive.
HP Sure Start
Select Intel-based 2013 HP Business Notebook PCs offer HP Sure Start, which provides hardware-based
assurance of the following:
●
HP-approved firmware is running on the HP Embedded Controller (EC) – EC Options in BIOS found under
“BIOS Integrity Checking”
●
An HP-approved BIOS is running on the host processor
HP Sure Start verifies the integrity of critical, non-executable platform data residing in the main flash and
provides selfhealing mechanisms to restore any code or critical platform data that has been lost or is
corrupted within the flash.
In conjunction with BIOS support, code running on the EC verifies the integrity of the following:
●
Subset of BIOS contents including the boot block portion and machine-unique data
●
Entire descriptor region
●
Entire Network Controller Configuration
The EC is responsible for power control/power cycle, thermal monitor/fan control, many LEDs, and PS2
keyboard and mouse.

Questions and answers
1. How can the BIOS settings be restored (returned to factory settings)?
a. Turn on or restart the computer and press F10 when prompted near the bottom of the display.
b. Select File, then select Restore defaults.
c. Follow the on-screen instructions.
d. Select File, save changes and exit, then press Enter.
2. What kind of configuration data is stored on the DIMM Serial Presence Detect (SPD) memory
module? How would this data be written?
The DIMM SPD memory contains information about the memory module such as size, serial number,
data width, speed/timing, voltage and thermal information. This information is written by the module
manufacturer and stored on an EEPROM. This EEPROM cannot be written to when the memory module is
installed in a PC. Third party tools do exist that can write to the EEPROM when the memory module is
not installed in a PC. There are various third party tools available to read SPD memory.
3. Does the “Firmware Hub for System BIOS” contain the BIOS program? Is this chip writable, and if so
how?
146 Chapter 14   Statement of Volatility

--- Page 159 ---
The Firmware Hub does contain the BIOS program and is writable. A utility is required to perform the
write function.
4. In some PC systems, the Firmware Hub for System BIOS is a flash memory chip so that updates can
be written by the customer. Is this true for these BIOS chips?
Yes, they are flash memory chips.
5. What is meant by “Restore the nonvolatile memory found in Intel-based system boards”?
This relates to clearing the Real Time Clock (RTC) CMOS memory that contains PC configuration data.
6. Does resetting the CMOS configuration memory return the PC back to factory defaults?
The process of resetting the CMOS will return certain system settings to factory default but will not
reset many of the system data and configuration defaults to their factory settings. To return these
system data and configuration defaults to factory settings, refer to question and answer 1 and follow
the instructions for returning the BIOS settings to factory defaults.
