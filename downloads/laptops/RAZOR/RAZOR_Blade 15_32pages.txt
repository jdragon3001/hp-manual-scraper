WARNING: Riding an electric motor bike does present potential 
risks and caution is required. Like any riding product, an electric motor bike 
has inherent hazards associated with its use (for example, falling off or 
riding it into a hazardous situation). Like any riding product, electric motor 
bikes can and are intended to move and it is therefore, of course, possible 
to lose control or otherwise get into dangerous situations. Both children, 
and adults responsible for supervising them, must recognize that if such 
things occur, a rider can be seriously injured or die even when using safety 
equipment and other precautions. RIDE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND USE 
COMMON SENSE.
WARNING: PARENTAL AND ADULT RESPONSIBILITY AND 
SUPERVISION NECESSARY: This manual contains important safety 
information. It is your responsibility to review this information and make 
sure that all riders understand all warnings, cautions, instructions and 
safety topics, and assure that young riders are able to safely and responsibly 
use these products. Razor recommends that you periodically review and 
reinforce the information in this manual with younger riders, and that you 
inspect and maintain your children’s product to ensure their safety.
WARNING: PARENT CONTROLLED HIGH/LOW SPEED 
SWITCH: The Indian Youth eFTR has a HIGH-LOW speed switch which 
can be manually set by an adult before children ride it. This switch allows 
parents to reduce the Indian Youth eFTR speed for novice riders. See 
page 6.
Manufacturer’s suggested minimum rider age is 14+ in the HIGH speed 
setting and 8+ in the LOW speed setting. The default setting is LOW.
WARNING: THE Indian Youth eFTR IS NOT FOR CHILDREN 
UNDER AGE 8 OR HEAVIER THAN 175 LB (79 KG). Because products, 
like electric motor bikes, can and do present potential hazards plainly 
associated with their use, it is well recognized THE NEED FOR EXERCISE 
OF PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY IN SELECTING RIDING PRODUCTS 
APPROPRIATE TO THE AGE OF A CHILD, OR PARENTAL SUPERVISION 
IN SITUATIONS IN WHICH CHILDREN OF VARIOUS AGES MAY HAVE 
ACCESS TO THE SAME RIDING PRODUCTS, IS IMPORTANT. Not every 
product is appropriate for every age or size of child, and different age 
recommendations are found within this category of product which are 
intended to reﬂect the nature of the hazards and the expected mental or 
physical ability, or both, of a rider to cope with the hazards.
Razor recommends that children under the age of 8 not be permitted to 
use the Indian Youth eFTR. This recommendation is based not just on age 
or weight or height – it reﬂects consideration of expected maturity and 
skills as well as physical size. The recommended rider age of 8 years or 
older for Indian Youth eFTR are only estimates and can be affected by the 
rider’s size, weight or skills – not every child 8 years old will be suited to 
the Indian Youth eFTR. Certainly, any rider unable to ﬁt comfortably on the 
Indian Youth eFTR should not attempt to ride it, but a parent’s decision  
to allow his or her child to ride these products should be based 
on the child’s maturity, skill,  and ability to follow rules. Razor 
emphasizes that adults are strongly advised not to disregard 
Razor’s recommendations or permit younger children to ride the 
Indian Youth eFTR.
DO NOT EXCEED THE WEIGHT LIMIT OF 175 lb (79 kg) for Indian 
Youth eFTR. Rider weight alone also does not necessarily mean a 
person’s size is appropriate to ﬁt or maintain control of the Indian 
Youth eFTR. Keep these products away from small children and 
remember that these products are intended for use only by persons 
who are, at a minimum, completely comfortable and competent 
while operating these products.
Persons with any mental or physical conditions that may make them 
susceptible to injury, impair their physical dexterity or mental capabilities 
to recognize, understand, and follow safety instructions and to be able to 
understand the hazards inherent in a product’s use, should not use or be 
permitted to use products inappropriate for their abilities. Persons with 
heart conditions, head, back or neck ailments (or prior surgeries to these 
areas of the body), or pregnant women, should be cautioned not to operate 
these products.
CHECK AND MAINTAIN MOTOR BIKE CONDITIONS
Before use, check to conﬁrm that any and all chain guards or other covers 
and guards are in place and in serviceable condition. Check that the 
brakes are functioning properly, and that tires are inﬂated properly and 
have sufﬁcient tread remaining. The motor bike should be maintained 
and repaired in accordance with the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations, using 
only the manufacturer’s authorized replacement parts, and should not be 
modiﬁed from the manufacturer’s original design and conﬁguration. 
ACCEPTABLE RIDING PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS
Always check and obey any local laws or regulations, which may 
affect the locations where the electric motor bike may be used. 
Keep safely away from cars and motor vehicle trafﬁc at all times, 
and only use where allowed and with caution.
Do not activate the speed control on the hand grip unless you are on the 
motor bike and in a safe, outdoor environment suitable for riding.
The normal powered top speed of the Indian eFTR will be approximately 15 
mph (24 km/h) in the HIGH speed setting and 10 mph (16 km/h) in the LOW 
speed setting, which can be affected by conditions, such as rider weight, 
inclines, tire inﬂation and battery charge level. Avoid excessive speeds that 
can be associated with downhill rides.
Maintain a hold on the handlebars at all times. Do not touch the brakes or 
motor on your motor bike when in use or immediately after riding, as these 
parts can become very hot.
Ride defensively. Watch out for potential obstacles that could catch your 
wheel or force you to swerve suddenly or lose control. Be careful to avoid 
pedestrians, skaters, skateboards, scooters, bikes, children or animals who 
may enter your path, and respect the rights and property of others.
These electric motor bikes are intended for use on ﬂat, dry surfaces, such as 
pavement or level ground, without loose debris, such as sand, leaves, rocks 
or gravel. Wet, slick, bumpy, uneven or rough surfaces may impair traction 
and contribute to possible accidents. Do not ride your motor bike in mud, ice, 
puddles or water. Watch out for potential obstacles that could catch your 
wheel or force you to swerve suddenly or lose control. Avoid sharp bumps, 
drainage grates, and sudden surface changes.

WARNING: 
Do not use the electric product for 
the ﬁrst time until you have inﬂated 
the tires  to the correct PSI. Failure 
to do so may damage your motor 
bike and void your warranty.
WARNING: 
Do not over inﬂate, as this could 
damage tire or wheel.
Note: The pressurized air supplies 
found at gasoline stations are 
designed to inﬂate high-volume 
automobile tires. If you decide to 
use such an air supply to inﬂate your 
motor bike tires, ﬁrst make sure the 
pressure gauge is working, then 
use very short bursts to inﬂate to 
the correct PSI. If you inadvertently 
over-inﬂate the tire, release the 
excess pressure immediately.
1 Using a bicycle-style tire pump equipped for a Schrader-type valve, inﬂate 
the front tire to the correct PSI indicated on the sidewall of the tire.

HEADLINEASSEMBLY AND SET-UP
Parent Controlled HIGH/LOW Speed Switch
Your Indian Youth eFTR features a hidden speed control switch that allows parents to discreetly reduce (or raise) 
the Indian Youth eFTR’s top speed. This limiter is intended for parents of younger children and those needing extra 
practice time to learn how the Indian Youth eFTR moves. It is recommended that all riders use the LOW setting while 
learning how to operate the Indian Youth eFTR. Once the rider is comfortable with using the Indian Youth eFTR in the 
LOW setting, and has acquired the necessary skills to safely ride the Indian Youth eFTR, the parent has the option to 
change the setting to the HIGH setting.
The switch has been hidden inside the Indian Youth eFTR’s speed control switch cover, such that riders cannot 
access it without using a Phillips screwdriver. There are two settings:
• When the switch is in the HIGH position, the Indian Youth eFTR has a top speed of 15 mph (24 km/h) and the 
recommended minimum rider age is 14 years old.
• When the switch is in the LOW position, the Indian Youth eFTR’s top speed is limited to 10 mph (16 km/h). This is 
the default setting and recommended for riders age 8 and older.
 Setting Speed Control Switch to LOW
Required Tool: Phillips Screwdriver
The LOW setting allows for speeds up to 10 mph (16 km/h).
Note: The Indian Youth eFTR is set on the LOW speed setting at the factory.

An excessive overload, such as too heavy a rider or too steep a 
hill, could cause the motor to overheat. Replace the fuse(s) with 
a new one of equal amperage. Correct the conditions that caused 
the fuse to burn out and avoid repeatedly burning out fuse. Refer 
to “Replacing the Fuse” on page 9.

MISES EN GARDE: Circuler en moto électrique comporte 
certains risques et il faut être prudent. Comme n’importe quel produit à 
piloter, une moto électrique présente certains dangers liés à son utilisation 
(par exemple, tomber ou circuler dans des situations dangereuses). Comme 
n’importe quel produit à piloter, les motos électriques sont conçues pour 
les déplacements, et il est donc, bien évidemment, possible d’en perdre la 
maîtrise ou de se retrouver dans des situations dangereuses. Les enfants 
et les adultes chargés de les surveiller doivent comprendre que si une telle 
situation se présente, un utilisateur peut subir des blessures graves, voire 
mortelles, même s’il utilise un équipement de sécurité et prend d’autres 
précautions. CONDUIRE À SES PROPRES RISQUES ET FAIRE PREUVE DE 
BON SENS.
MISES EN GARDE: LA RESPONSABILITÉ ET LA 
SUPERVISION PARENTALE ET ADULTE SONT NÉCESSAIRES: Ce 
manuel contient des informations de sécurité importantes. Il est de votre 
responsabilité d’étudier ces informations et de vous assurer que tous 
les utilisateurs comprennent tous les avertissements, mises en garde, 
instructions et consignes de sécurité. Vous devez également vous assurer 
que les jeunes usagers sont capables d’utiliser ces produits en toute sécurité 
et de façon responsable. Avec de jeunes usagers, Razor recommande de 
reprendre régulièrement les informations contenues 
dans ce manuel et d’en souligner de nouveau l’importance; vous êtes 
également tenu d’inspecter et d’entretenir le produit de votre enfant pour 
assurer sa sécurité.
MISES EN GARDE: INTERRUPTEUR DE VITESSE HIGH/
LOW (ÉLEVÉE/FAIBLE) RÉGLÉ PAR LES PARENTS: La moto Indian 
Youth eFTR possède un interrupteur de vitesse HIGH/LOW (élevée/faible) 
qui peut être réglé manuellement par un adulte avant que les enfants ne 
l’utilisent. Cet interrupteur permet aux parents de réduire la vitesse de la 
moto Indian Youth eFTR pour les pilotes novices. Voir la page22.
L’âge minimum suggéré par le fabricant est de 13ans et + pour la vitesse 
HIGH (élevée) et de 8 ans et plus pour la vitesse LOW (faible). Le réglage par 
défaut est LOW (faible).
MISES EN GARDE: LA MOTO Indian Youth eFTR N’EST 
PAS DESTINÉE AUX ENFANTS DE MOINS DE 8ANS OU DE PLUS 
DE 79KG (175LB). Comme certains produits, par exemple les motos 
électriques, peuvent être dangereux à utiliser, il est essentiel que LES 
PARENTS EXERCENT LEUR RESPONSABILITÉ EN SÉLECTIONNANT LES 
PRODUITS EN FONCTION DE L’ÂGE DE L’ENFANT OU SOIENT PRÉSENTS 
LORSQUE DES ENFANTS D’ÂGES DIVERS UTILISENT LE MÊME PRODUIT. 
Parce que les produits peuvent ne pas être appropriés pour les enfants de 
tout âge ou de toute taille, il existe différentes recommandations relatives 
à l’âge dans cette catégorie de produits, qui ont pour but de reﬂéter la 
nature des dangers et les capacités physiques ou mentales qu’un pilote doit 
posséder pour faire face aux dangers.
Razor recommande que les enfants de moins de 8ans ne soient pas 
autorisés à utiliser la moto Indian Youth eFTR. Cette recommandation n’est 
pas uniquement basée sur l’âge, le poids ou la taille; elle tient compte de 
la maturité et des compétences attendues ainsi que de la taille physique. 
L’âge recommandé de 8ans ou plus pour l’utilisation de la moto Indian Youth 
eFTR n’est qu’une estimation et peut être affecté par la taille, le poids ou les 
compétences du pilote; ce ne sont pas tous les enfants de 8ans qui seront 
adaptés à la moto Indian Youth eFTR. Certainement, toute personne ne se 
sentant pas à l’aise sur la moto Indian Youth eFTR ne doit pas essayer de le 
conduire mais les parents doivent décider s’ils permettent ou non à 
leur enfant d’utiliser ces produits selon sa maturité, ses capacités 
et son aptitude à respecter les consignes. Razor insiste sur le fait 
qu’il est fortement conseillé aux adultes de ne pas ignorer les 
recommandations de Razor et de ne pas autoriser de plus jeunes 
enfants à conduire la moto Indian Youth eFTR.
NE PAS DÉPASSER LA LIMITE DE POIDS DE 79kg (175lb) pour la 
moto Indian Youth eFTR. Le poids de l’utilisateur uniquement ne 
signiﬁe pas forcément que la taille de la personne est appropriée 
pour convenir  à la moto Indian Youth eFTR. ou en maintenir le 
contrôle. Tenir ces produits hors de portée des enfants en bas âge et 
rappelez-vous qu’ils sont exclusivement destinés à des personnes 
qui, au minimum, se sentent totalement à l’aise et compétentes pour 
utiliser ces produits.
Toute personne présentant des problèmes mentaux ou physiques qui 
l’exposent aux blessures ou qui risquent de nuire à sa dextérité ou à sa 
capacité mentale de reconnaître, comprendre et suivre les directives de 
sécurité et à sa capacité de comprendre le danger relatif à l’utilisation d’un 
produit ne doit pas utiliser ou avoir la permission d’utiliser des produits dont 
ils ne peuvent avoir la maîtrise. Il faut empêcher les personnes souffrant 
de maladies cardiaques, de douleurs à la tête, au dos ou au cou (ou ayant 
subi des opérations à ces parties du corps) et les femmes enceintes d’utiliser 
ces produits.
VÉRIFIER L’ÉTAT DE LA MOTO ET L’ENTRETENIR CORRECTEMENT
Avant son utilisation, vériﬁer que tous les protecteurs de chaîne ou tous les 
autres couvercles et protecteurs sont en place et en bon état. Vériﬁer que le 
freins fonctionnent correctement et que les pneus sont gonﬂés correctement 
et ont une bande de roulement sufﬁsante. Il est important d’entretenir et de 
réparer la moto selon les spéciﬁcations émises par le fabricant, de n’utiliser 
que des pièces de remplacement autorisées et de ne pas modiﬁer sa 
conception et sa conﬁguration d’origine.
PRATIQUES ET CONDITIONS DE CONDUITE ACCEPTABLES
Toujours vériﬁer et respecter les lois ou règlementations locales 
applicables aux endroits où le produit peut être utilisé. Maintenir 
constamment une distance sécuritaire avec les véhicules motorisés 
et l’utiliser avec précaution uniquement dans les endroits autorisés.
Ne pas actionner la commande de la vitesse sur la poignée tant que vous 
n’êtes pas sur la moto et dans un environnement extérieur approprié et 
sécuritaire pour rouler.

AVERTISSEMENTS DE SÉCURITÉ
La vitesse maximale normale de la moto Indian Youth eFTR est d’environ 
24km/h (15mi/h) en réglage de vitesse HIGH (élevée) et de 16km/h 
(10mi/h) en réglage de vitesse LOW (faible). Cette vitesse peut être 
affectée par certaines conditions, comme le poids du pilote, les pentes, le 
gonﬂage des pneus et le niveau de charge de la batterie. Éviter les vitesses 
excessives liées aux descentes de pente.
Garder les mains sur le guidon en tout temps. Ne pas toucher au frein ou au 
moteur de votre moto lorsqu’elle est en marche ou immédiatement après son 
utilisation, car ces pièces peuvent être très chaudes.
Conduire en restant vigilant. Prendre garde aux obstacles potentiels qui 
pourraient accrocher votre roue ou vous forcer à tourner brusquement ou 
à perdre la maîtrise. Veiller à éviter les piétons, les utilisateurs de patins 
à roues alignées, les planches à roulettes, les trottinettes, les vélos, les 
enfants ou les animaux qui pourraient couper votre trajectoire; respecter les 
droits et la propriété d’autrui.
Ces motos électriques sont conçues pour être utilisées sur un sol plat et 
sec, comme des trottoirs ou des terrains plats exempts de débris comme 
du sable, des feuilles, des cailloux ou du gravier. Les surfaces humides, 
glissantes, bosselées, inégales ou cahoteuses peuvent réduire l’adhérence 
et contribuer à d’éventuels accidents. Ne pas utiliser votre moto dans la 
boue, sur la glace, dans les ﬂaques ou l’eau. Prendre garde aux obstacles 
potentiels qui pourraient accrocher votre roue ou vous forcer à tourner 
brusquement ou à perdre la maîtrise. Éviter les bosses, les bouches d’égout 
et les changements brusques de surface.
Ne pas tenter de faire ou ne pas faire d’acrobaties ou de ﬁgures sur votre 
moto électrique. Ces motos ne sont pas conçues pour résister à des abus 
tels que les sauts, grimper sur des trottoirs ou toute autre acrobatie. Les 
courses et l’exécution d’acrobaties ou d’autres manœuvres augmentent 
également les risques de perte de contrôle ou peuvent entraîner des actions 
ou des réactions non maîtrisées par l’utilisateur.
Ne jamais laisser plus d’une personne à la fois monter sur la moto.
Ne pas rouler la nuit ou lorsque la visibilité est limitée.
Ne jamais l’utiliser à proximité de marches ou de piscines.
Ne jamais laisser de mains, de pieds, de cheveux, de parties du corps, de 
vêtements ou d’autres articles semblables entrer en contact avec les pièces 
mobiles, les roues ou la transmission lorsque le moteur est en marche.
Ne jamais utiliser d’écouteurs, un téléphone cellulaire ou envoyer des 
messages textes lorsqu’on conduit.
Ne jamais s’accrocher à un autre véhicule.
Ne pas conduire la moto par temps humide ou en présence de verglas et 
ne jamais immerger la moto dans l’eau, car les composants électriques 
et de transmission risquent d’être endommagés par l’eau ou entraîner 
d’autres conditions potentiellement non sécuritaires. Ne jamais risquer 
d’endommager des surfaces telles que de la moquette ou du plancher en 
utilisant une moto électrique à l’intérieur.
VÊTEMENTS APPROPRIÉS
Toujours porter un équipement de protection approprié, comme un casque de 
sécurité homologué (avec la sangle correctement bouclée) et des protections 
pour coudes et genoux. Les lois et règlements locaux peuvent exiger le port 
du casque. Il est recommandé de porter un chandail à manches longues, 
un pantalon et des gants. Toujours porter des chaussures de sport (des 
chaussures à lacets avec des semelles caoutchouc) et veiller à ce que ses 
lacets restent noués et hors de la trajectoire des roues, du moteur et du 
système de transmission. Ne jamais conduire pieds nus ou en sandales.
UTILISATION DU CHARGEUR
Le chargeur fourni avec la moto électrique doit être examiné régulièrement 
pour déceler des dommages au cordon, à la prise, au boîtier et à d’autres 
pièces. En cas de tel dommage, le produit ne doit pas être chargé tant que le 
chargeur n’a pas été réparé ou remplacé.
Utiliser uniquement le chargeur recommandé.
Faire preuve de prudence durant la charge.
Le chargeur n’est pas un jouet. Le chargeur doit être utilisé par un adulte.
Ne pas utiliser le chargeur à proximité de matières inﬂammables.
Débrancher le chargeur de la prise et de le produit lorsqu’il n’est pas utilisé.
Toujours déconnecter le chargeur avant d’essuyer et de nettoyer le produit à 
l’aide d’un linge humide.
LE DÉFAUT DE FAIRE PREUVE DE BON SENS ET LE NON-RESPECT 
DES MISES EN GARDE ÉNONCÉES CI-DESSUS AUGMENTENT 
LES RISQUES DE BLESSURES GRAVES. UTILISER À VOS PROPRES 
RISQUES ET PORTER UNE ATTENTION PARTICULIÈRE À LA 
SÉCURITÉ. FAIRE PREUVE DE PRUDENCE.

Interrupteur de vitesse HIGH/LOW (élevée/faible) géré par les parents
Votre moto Indian Youth eFTR dispose d’un interrupteur de commande de vitesse caché qui permet aux parents de 
réduire (ou d’augmenter) discrètement la vitesse maximale de la moto Indian Youth eFTR. Ce limiteur est destiné 
aux parents de jeunes enfants et à ceux qui ont besoin d’un temps de pratique supplémentaire pour apprendre les 
mouvements de la moto Indian Youth eFTR. Il est recommandé que tous les pilotes utilisent le réglage LOW (faible) 
pendant qu’ils apprennent à utiliser la moto Indian Youth eFTR. Une fois que le pilote est à l’aise avec la moto Indian 
Youth eFTR en réglage LOW (faible), et qu’il a acquis les compétences nécessaires pour conduire la moto Indian 
Youth eFTR en toute sécurité, le parent a la possibilité de passer au réglage HIGH (élevée).
L’interrupteur a été caché dans le couvercle de l’interrupteur de commande de vitesse de la moto Indian Youth eFTR, 
de sorte que les pilotes ne peuvent pas y accéder sans utiliser un tournevis Phillips. Il y a deux réglages:
• Lorsque l’interrupteur est en position HIGH (élevée), la moto Indian Youth eFTR a une vitesse maximale de 24km/h 
(15mi/h) et l’âge minimum recommandé pour le pilote est de 14ans.
• Lorsque l’interrupteur est en position LOW (faible), la vitesse maximale de la moto Indian Youth eFTR est limitée à 
16km/h (10mph). Il s’agit du réglage par défaut et il est recommandé pour les pilotes âgés de 8ans et plus.
 
Réglage de l’interrupteur de commande de vitesse sur LOW (faible)
Outil nécessaire: Tournevis Phillips
Le réglage LOW (faible) permet d’atteindre une vitesse de 16km/h (10mi/h).

Chargeur
Freins
Vériﬁer le bon fonctionnement du frein. Lorsqu’on actionne les leviers, les 
freins doivent entraîner une action de freinage positive. S’assurer que les 
freins ne frottent pas lorsque les leviers sont relâchés.
Pneus
Inspectez périodiquement les pneus pour détecter une usure excessive et 
remplacez-les si nécessaire. Vériﬁez régulièrement la pression des pneus 
et gonﬂez-les si nécessaire. Si votre pneu est à plat, la chambre à air 
intérieure peut être réparée avec une pièce ou une nouvelle chambre à 
air peut être achetée chez Razor ou un atelier de réparation homologué.
 
Cadre, fourche et guidon
Vériﬁer si les connexions présentent des ﬁssures ou des ruptures. Bien 
que les cadres se brisent rarement, il est possible qu’un conducteur 
agressif heurte une bordure de trottoir ou un autre objet, ce qui peut 
endommager et tordre ou briser le cadre. Prendre l’habitude d’inspecter 
votre produit sur une base régulière.
Quincaillerie/pièces détachées
Vériﬁer que toutes les pièces telles que les boulons, les écrous, les 
câbles, les ﬁxations, etc., sont sécuritaires et assemblées correctement. 
Aucune vibration ou son anormal ne doit provenir des pièces mobiles ou 
des composants brisés. Si l’engin est endommagé, ne pas l’utiliser. Se 
reporter aux Avertissements de sécurité aux pages 17 et 18 de 
ce manuel.
Équipement de sécurité
Toujours porter un équipement de protection adapté, tel qu’un casque 
de sécurité homologué. Il est recommandé de porter des coudières, des 
genouillères, un pantalon et des manches longues. Toujours porter des 
chaussures à orteils fermés (à lacets avec des semelles caoutchouc) et veiller 
à ce que ses lacets restent noués et hors de la trajectoire des roues, du 
moteur et du système de transmission. NE JAMAIS CONDUIRE PIEDS NUS 
OU EN SANDALES.
Lois et réglementations
Toujours consulter et respecter les lois et réglementations locales.
Assurance
Ne pas présumer que votre assurance couvre nécessairement l’utilisation 
d’une moto électrique. Vériﬁer auprès de sa compagnie d’assurance.
Remisage
Une exposition prolongée aux rayons UV, à la pluie et aux intempéries peut 
endommager les matériaux du boîtier, le ranger à l’intérieur lorsqu’il n’est 
pas utilisé.

RÉPARATION ET ENTRETIEN
Besoin d’aide? Visiter notre site Web pour les pièces de remplacement, le soutien pour le produit, une liste des centres de service autorisés aux États-Unis 
et les coordonnées du soutien à la clientèle à l’adresse www.razor.com. Veuillez avoir en main le code d’identiﬁcation du produit (sur l’étiquette blanche du 
produit) pour faciliter l’assistance. Les coordonnées du soutien à la clientèle supplémentaires se trouvent au dos du présent manuel.
MISES EN GARDE: Les 
freins sont en mesure de bloquer la 
roue de la moto électrique et d’éjecter 
un usager conﬁant. Pratiquez dans un 
espace ouvert libre d’obstacles tant 
que vous n’êtes pas familier avec le 
fonctionnement du frein. Éviter de 
déraper pour s’arrêter, car cela peut 
provoquer une perte de contrôle ou 
endommager le pneu arrière.
Vériﬁcation des freins. Pour 
utiliser les freins, actionner les leviers 
pour augmenter la pression sur 
les freins. Les leviers de frein sont 
équipées d’un dispositif de réglage 
du câble permettant de compenser 
la tension du câble et de régler le 
mouvement du levier pour engager le 
frein. Si les freins ne s’engagent pas 
correctement, suivre les instructions 
pour le réglage des freins.
Remarque: Le levier de frein est 
équipé d’un interrupteur de sécurité 
permettant d’arrêter le moteur 
lorsque le frein est activé. En cas 
d’urgence, actionner le frein permet 
d’arrêter le produit. Ne pas 
désactiver ou remplacer le levier 
par un levier autre qu’une pièce de 
rechange Razor d’origine.
Mettre l’interrupteur à OFF (hors tension) avant de procéder à une réparation ou un entretien:
• Lire les instructions
• Retirer la ﬁche du chargeur
• Mettre l’engin hors tension
• Sécuriser l’engin en cours 
de réparation
• Faire preuve de prudence avec les 
pièces exposées
• Communiquer avec le service 
à la clientèle de Razor en cas 
d’incertitude relative à une 
réparation ou un entretien
2 Si le frein a trop de jeu, desserrer 
le boulon d’ancrage arrière au 
moyen d’une clé Allen de 5mm 
et tendre davantage le câble. La 
distance du câble de frein entre 
l’embout du câble et le boulon 
d’ancrage devrait être entre 37mm 
et 44mm.
3 Si le rotor du frein force sur les 
plaquettes de frein, utilisez vos 
doigts pour tourner la mollette 
de réglage de la mâchoire dans 
un sens ou dans l’autre, jusqu’à 
ce que le rotor soit centré entre 
les plaquettes.
1 Pour régler le frein, tourner la 
mollette de réglage de 1/4 ou de 
1/2 tour jusqu’à ce que le réglage 
souhaité soit obtenu. La plupart 
du temps, le réglage est terminé 
à cette étape. Si un réglage 
supplémentaire s’avère toujours 
nécessaire, passer à l’étape 2.
 Ajustement des freins avant et arrière
Outil nécessair: Clé hexagonale 5mm
