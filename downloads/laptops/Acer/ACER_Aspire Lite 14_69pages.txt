Your guides
To help you use your Acer notebook, we have designed a set of 
guides:
First off, the Setup Guide helps you get started with setting up your 
computer.
For more on how your computer can help you to be more productive, 
please refer to the User’s Manual.  This guide contains detailed 
information on such subjects as system utilities, data recovery, 
expansion options and troubleshooting.
Once you have connected to the internet, you can download updates 
for your computer from: 
http://go.acer.com/support 
1. The link will open the Acer Support webpage.
2. Scroll down to Drivers and Manuals and search for your model by 
pasting in or manually entering the serial number, SNID, or 
product model.
3. From this page you can also download and install the Acer 
identification utility that will automatically detect your computer’s 
serial number and SNID and allow you to copy it to the clipboard.
4. Once you have found your product model, any updates, or 
documents will be listed.
