Automatic Backlight Control 
 
Function 
 
Automatic Backlight Control is to automatically adjust the backlight brightness 
based on the light condition detected by the ambient light sensor. 
 
How Automatic Backlight Control Works 
 
1.  For FlyBook V5, backlight brightness is controllable under two means, one is 
manual backlight control (by using hot-keys or through FlyBook Control 
Center) and the other is Automatic Backlight Control. 
 
2.  Manual backlight control dominates over Automatic Backlight Control. 
Automatic Backlight Control is inactivated every time backlight brightness 
is manually adjusted. User needs to press hot-key Fn + A to reactivate the 
Automatic Backlight Control. 
 
3. When Automatic Backlight Control is on, backlight brightness will 
automatically adjust to the light condition detected. Light conditions are 
ranked in 6 degrees, and each degree has its corresponding backlight 
brightness. 
 
4.  The ambient light sensor of FlyBook V5 is on by default. When the light is 
bright, screen brightness increases automatically. When the light is dim, 
screen brightness decreases automatically. 
 
5.  Automatic Backlight Control is the default backlight control. It is activated 
every time operating system starts. 
 
6.  You can try to block the Light Sensor with your hand. When you do so for 2 
seconds, the backlight of display will turn dark, and once you remove your 
hand, after 2 seconds, the backlight will recover the brightness.

you have set the network name (SSID) and key to the same values as the 
access point (infrastructure connection) or the computers to be connected (Ad 
Hoc connection) have. 
 
2.  Your V5 may be too far from other communication devices. Retry the 
connection after moving your computer closer to the computers to be 
connected with (Ad Hoc connection) or to the access point (infrastructure 
connection). Also, check the condition of the signal strength in      [Connect to 
a network] window by clicking Control Panel -> Network and Sharing 
Center -> Connect to a network.

7.  To have your operating system identifying the problem, go to Control Panel, in 
Classic View mode, select Network and Sharing Center. In Network and 
Sharing Center window, click on Connect to a network. In [Connect to a 
network] window, select Diagnose why Windows cannot find any 
additional networks. 
 
Cannot charge battery or losing power quickly 
 
1.  Verify that the battery is properly installed and it is not too hot or too cold. 
 
2.  Calibrate the battery. 
 
3.  The installed battery may be faulty. Replace it with a new one. 
 
Having V5 Serviced 
 
If you are unable to solve the problem, you should have your V5 serviced. Pack it 
in the original carton. Include a description of the problem and a checklist of the 
steps you took when trying to fix the problem. The information may be useful to 
the service personnel. Return the V5 to the place you purchased it.
