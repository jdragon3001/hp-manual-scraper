Installing Spyware Blocker
Spyware typically retrieves information about your Web-
surfing habits. It can be secretly installed on your computer 
with a free download and can even be installed just by visit-
ing a Web site. Spyware can cause your Web searches to 
be redirected and pop up annoying adds. Once your com-
puter is infected with spyware, it can be very difficult to 
remove. The key is to prevent infection in the first place by 
installing spyware blocker software. Spyware blocking soft-
ware can be purchased online; and you can even download 
free spyware blocking programs.

Ergonomics is the science of equipment design, particularly 
for working situations, with the intention of reducing dis-
comfort. Ergonomic products, such as keyboards or mice, 
are designed to blend smoothly with your actions.
When using your computer try to develop good habits such 
as the following:
• Periodically get up, stretch and walk around the room.
• Look away from the display frequently. Don’t face a wall 
so that you can look up from the screen and into the dis-
tance. This exercising of the eyes can help to prevent 
eye-strain.
• Do stretching exercises while you sit.
• Don’t work in poor lighting. Position your computer dis-
play to minimize glare or reflection.
