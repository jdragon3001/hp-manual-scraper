Information on the return of electrical and electronic waste 
in EU countries according to Directive 2002/96/EC, and its im-
plementation in respective national regulations
a) Reason and Purpose of Separate Collection
Users of electrical and electronic equipment are required to dispose of used devices sepa-
rately. Electrical and electronic equipment must not be disposed of together with unsorted 
municipal solid waste (domestic refuse), as it contains a range of dangerous elements that 
cause problems for waste management. Separate collection from regular municipal waste 
is a prerequisite for the special treatment and appropriate recycling of electrical and elec-
tronic waste. This is essential, as many components of electrical and electronic devices are 
damaging to the environment if they are not disposed of professionally. Disposing of the 
devices along with unsorted municipal waste can cause harmful substances to enter the 
waste ﬂow. The consequence would be a considerable burden on the environment.
b) Signiﬁcance the ‘Crossed-Out Wheelie Bin’
The crossed-out wheelie bin is the symbol for separate collection.
Electrical and electronic equipment marked with this symbol must not be 
disposed of to-gether with municipal sorted waste (domestic refuse). Such 
items can be handed in free of charge at public collection points.
c) Reuse, Recycling and Recovery
Electrical  and  electronic  waste  contains  valuable  raw  materials  such  as  iron,  aluminum 
and copper. These components must be treated selectively. A separate collection and a 
selec-tive treatment are the basis for environmentally-friendly disposal and protection of 
human health.
According to the particular terms, manufacturers are obligated to assume the costs associ-
ated with disposing of these devices as well as other obligations. This is to promote the 
chief objectives of reuse and recycling. For this to be possible, consumers must dispose of 
used devices that are no longer needed at communal collection points. Actively using these 
return and collection systems contributes to the reuse, recycling and recovery of electrical 
and electronic equipment and protects the environment.
d) Weight
Information on the weight of the acquired product can be found on the item list as well as 
on the packaging.

Wireless LAN
(wireless network - abbreviation = WLAN)
Your notebook may contain a Wireless LAN module (optional). This module allows you to set 
up a wireless-based network, and to connect with an existing wireless network. It works 
according to the IEEE802.11b+g standard.
WLAN technology allows users to set up wireless connections inside a local area (e.g. in 
a company or campus building, or in a public building such as an airport). WLANs can be 
used in temporary ofﬁces, in locations where it is not possible to set up extensive cable 
installations, or to extend an existing LAN so that users in different parts of a building can 
work at different times.
There are two different ways to operate a WLAN.
In ﬁxed WLANs, wireless stations (devices with radio network cards or external modems) 
set up connections with wireless access points, which act as bridges between the stations 
and the existing network backbone. In Peer-to-Peer (ad hoc) WLANs several users can set 
up a temporary network within a limited area such as a conference room, without using 
access points, and providing there is no need to use network resources.
In 1997 the IEEE conﬁrmed the standard 802.11 for WLANs; this set a data transfer rate of 
1 to 2 Mbit/s (Megabits per second). Under 802.11b+g, the new governing standard, the 
maximum data transfer rate is 54 Mbps over a frequency band of 2.4 GHz.

Additional safety notes for units with wireless LAN
A wireless LAN component is integrated into your Notebook. For this reason you must make 
sure that you comply with the following notes on safety:
•  Switch off the Notebook when you are in an aircraft or 
while driving a car.
•  If you are in a hospital, an operating room or close to an 
electronic medical system, switch off the wireless compo
-
nents in the Notebook! The radio waves which are transmit-
ted could disrupt the working of the medical equipment.
•  Keep the Notebook at least 20 cm away from a heart pace
-
maker, otherwise there is a risk that the radio waves could 
disrupt the normal working of the pacemaker.
•  The radio waves which are transmitted could give rise to 
interference noise in hearing aids.
•  When its radio components are switched on, do not place 
the Notebook close to inﬂammable gases or in an environ
-
ment which could be at risk of explosion (e.g. paint shop), 
since the radio waves which are transmitted could set of a 
ﬁre or an explosion. 
•  The range of the wireless connection depends on the envi
-
ronmental and other ambient conditions.
•  When transferring data over a wireless connection, unau
-
thorized Third Parties can also receive the data.
MAXDATA Computer GmbH is not responsible for disruptions to radio or television recep-
tion which are caused by unauthorized alterations to this unit. MAXDATA also accepts no 
responsibility for the replacement or the exchange of connecting cables and units which 
were not speciﬁed by MAXDATA Computer GmbH. The user alone is responsible for the 
elimination of disruptions caused by this type of unauthorized alteration; he is also respon
-
sible for the replacement or the exchange of the units.

The Data/Fax Modem
The system automatically sets up the integrated analog modem. To use the modem func-
tions,  connect  the  modem  socket  to  an  analog  telephone  socket  (not  ISDN)  using  the 
telephone cable.
Proper use:
The modem can be connected to all analog sockets in Europe.
It is to be used solely for data communication purposes.
Do not attempt to 
connect the modem 
to an ISDN telephone 
socket! This would re
-
sult in serious damage 
to the device.
The LAN Port
The  built-in  network  adapter  enables  your  computer  to  connect  to  the  Internet  via  a 
10/100 Mbps network or DSL.
The connection is made via an Ethernet network cable and RJ-45 connectors. These are 
connected to the notebook and to an available network hub or DSL socket.
Under no circumstanc-
es should you con-
fuse a network cable 
RJ-45 connector with 
an ISDN connector! 
NEVER attempt to con
-
nect the LAN adapter 
to an ISDN telephone 
socket!
This would result in 
serious damage to the 
device.

Installation Instructions
Restoring the Drivers
Your system is supplied in a preloaded condition. This means that all the data and drivers 
that the system requires are already on the hard disk. In case you erase and/or format your 
hard disk drive, the system drivers are stored on the Utility CD supplied with the computer. 
After reinstalling the operating system (for example, with the Recovery CD), this allows you 
to restore your notebook to a usable condition.
The Utility CD
The Utility CD will run automatically after you place it in the drive. If this is not the case, 
you can run the CD as follows: select <My Computer”> <CD Drive> and then the “utility.
exe” ﬁle.
You can select the driver that you want to install in the “Drivers” section. Recommended: 
Install all listed drivers from top to bottom.
In addition,  you can later install  the advanced functions you require in the “Utility” sec-
tion.
When using the Utility CD, please follow the menu instructions.

1280 × 800).

Right-click on any free area of the desktop. Select <Properties>.
In the Display Properties window, click the Settings tab.
Here you can set the slider to a resolution you ﬁnd comfortable.
Click <Apply> to set the resolution.
