Safety information
This section contains important information about the operation of your device. It also contains
information about how to use the device safely. Read this information carefully before using your
device.
Electronic device
Do not use your device if using the device is prohibited. Do not use the device if doing so causes
danger or interference with other electronic devices.
Interference with medical equipment
