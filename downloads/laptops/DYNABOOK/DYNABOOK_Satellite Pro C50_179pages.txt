management strategies that focus on recycling and reuse. This Directive requires 
producers of electrical and electronic products put on the market in European 
Union (EU) member countries after August 2005 to mark such products with a 
crossed-out wheeled bin with a black bar symbol. If the product’s battery or 
accumulator contains more than the specified values of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), 
and/or cadmium (Cd) defined in the Battery Directive (2006/66/EC), then the 
chemical symbols for lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and/or cadmium (Cd) will appear 
below the crossed out wheeled bin symbol on the battery.
In the European Union, these symbols indicate that when the last end user wishes 
to discard this product, it must be sent to appropriate facilities for recovery and 
recycling. This Directive applies to EU member countries only and does not 
apply to end users in other countries such as the United States.

Chapter 1
Getting Started
This chapter provides tips for using your computer effectively, 
summarizes how to connect components, and explains what to do 
the first time you use your computer.
Please read the safety instruction information on the Quick Start 
document (that shipped with your computer) carefully and make 
sure you fully understand the instructions before you attempt to use 
your computer in order to avoid potential hazards that could cause 
bodily injury, property damage, or damage the computer.
Selecting a place to work
Your computer is portable and designed to be used in a variety of 
circumstances and locations.
Setting up a work environment
Place the computer on a hard flat surface that is large enough for the 
computer and any other items you are using, such as a printer. 
Leave enough space around the computer and other equipment to 
provide adequate ventilation. Otherwise, they may overheat. 
To keep your computer in prime operating condition, protect your 
work area from:
❖ Dust, moisture, and direct sunlight.

--- Page 30 ---
30
Getting Started
Selecting a place to work
❖ Equipment that generates a strong electromagnetic field, such 
as stereo speakers (other than speakers that are connected to 
the computer) or speakerphones.
❖ Rapid changes in temperature or humidity and sources of 
temperature change such as air conditioner vents or heaters.
❖ Extreme heat, cold, or humidity.
❖ Liquids and corrosive chemicals.
Keeping yourself comfortable
This section provides information for setting up your work 
environment and tips for working comfortably throughout the day.
Computer user comfort recommendations
Good Working Posture
❖ Adjust your chair height: your feet should be flat on the floor 
and the bottom of your thighs should be evenly supported by 
the seat. If your feet cannot reach the floor, use a foot rest. 
Avoid pressure points behind the knee or under the thigh.
❖ The space under your desk should be free of clutter so that your 
legs and feet are not restricted, and you can get close enough to 
your notebook and other items that you use frequently.
❖ Adjust the chair back rest: it should match the curve of your 
back and provide comfortable back support.
❖ Adjust the chair arm rests: they should be about the same 
height as the keyboard and comfortably support your arms, 
allowing your shoulders to relax.
❖ When using the keyboard, it should be centered in front of you.
❖ The keyboard and pointing device should be close to your 
elbow level. The keyboard should be flat so that your wrists are 
straight when typing. However, if the notebook is on a work 
surface that is above your elbow height you may need to slope 
the notebook to keep your wrists straight.
❖ Work with relaxed shoulders.
❖ When typing, keep your wrists straight and try not to rest your 
wrists on the notebook. Support your arms on your forearm 
area. The forearms can be supported by the chair arm supports 
or the desk surface.
❖ The notebook display should be tilted so that the image on the 
screen is clear.

--- Page 31 ---
31
Getting Started
Selecting a place to work
❖ Avoid glare: position the notebook so that light sources (lamps 
or windows) do not shine or reflect directly into your eyes. 
Place the notebook display away from bright light sources or 
reduce the light intensity from windows by using blinds. Glare 
on the notebook display may cause eye strain, eye fatigue or 
headaches.
❖ Certain notebook displays have a brightness approaching that 
of a TV device. We recommend that you adjust the brightness 
of your notebook display to a comfortable level to prevent 
possible eye strain.
❖ Keep your head level, facing forward and balanced over your 
torso.
❖ Adjust the font size of text on your screen to make viewing 
comfortable.
❖ Rest your eyes periodically by focusing on objects that are 
farther away.
Using the notebook with an external keyboard, mouse or monitor
(Sample Illustration) Correct posture
❖ When using a notebook for long hours, it may be more 
comfortable to dock the notebook and use an external 
keyboard, mouse and monitor.
❖ The keyboard and mouse (or trackball) should be close to your 
elbow level.
❖ The mouse should be next to the keyboard to avoid a reach. If 
you have to reach, the arm should be supported in the forearm 
area by the desk surface or the chair arm supports.

--- Page 32 ---
32
Getting Started
Selecting a place to work
❖ Alternative keyboards, such as the split curved keyboard, may 
improve shoulder and arm comfort.
❖ Select a mouse that is comfortable for you to use.
❖ Don’t rest your wrists on the edge of the keyboard or on the 
work surface when typing.
❖ The monitor should be about an arm length away while sitting 
back in the chair.
❖ The monitor should be centered in front of your body.
❖ The top of the monitor should be at or slightly below eye level. 
A monitor that is too high or too low can cause awkward head 
and neck postures and may lead to discomfort in the neck 
muscles.
❖ If you use bifocals you may need to lower the monitor. 
Alternatively, you might consider customized prescription 
computer glasses.
Typing style
❖ Learn to touch type so that you don’t have to look down at the 
keyboard.
❖ Type with straight wrists.
❖ Type lightly.
❖ Learn the keyboard shortcuts for your applications. You will be 
more productive.
❖ Use the pointing device (e.g., touch pad, Accupoint
®
, or tablet 
pen whichever is available with your notebook computer, or 
other optional pointing devices like mouse or trackball) with a 
comfortable hand posture. Avoid awkward hand postures or 
high gripping force.
❖ It is helpful to change the type of pointing device that you use 
on a regular basis to avoid working in just one hand posture.
Taking breaks and varying tasks
❖ Change the way you work so that you are not stuck in the same 
posture for long periods of time. Some people find it 
comfortable to occasionally stand while using the notebook. To 
do this properly, the notebook needs to be on an elevated 
surface. Make sure you follow the Good Working Posture 
points mentioned above while working.

--- Page 33 ---
33
Getting Started
Selecting a place to work
❖ Take short, strategically spaced rest breaks to avoid eye strain 
and body fatigue. For example, stand up and walk around or 
stretch for a few minutes every hour.
❖ Taking regular breaks is especially important if you are 
working long hours on your computer or working on a 
deadline.
❖ If stress at work is affecting your health, try to identify the 
sources of the stress and evaluate ways to reduce the stress.
Mobile computing tips
❖ When using the notebook at airports, on airplanes or trains, or 
at meetings, make sure that you take the time to consider the 
points just mentioned.
❖ When working on the road it may be difficult to set up the 
notebook in an optimal position. In these situations it is 
important that you take frequent breaks and change your 
posture frequently to relieve the excess loads on your body.
❖ Be creative, when in a hotel room, use a rolled up blanket or 
pillows to provide back support, or to provide arm support. To 
position the computer at a good height, remember to operate 
the computer on a hard flat stable surface. Using your 
computer on a carpet, blanket or other soft materials can block 
the air vents including those located at the base of the computer 
and possibly cause overheating of your computer.
Transporting the notebook
Although your notebook is light, carrying it for a long time may 
lead to shoulder and arm fatigue. If you carry your notebook with 
other items, consider using an ergonomically-designed computer 
case.
Seeking additional help
Follow the advice from your employer’s company health and safety 
staff. Contact them if you need assistance making adjustment to 
your workstation or adjusting the lighting.
Again, if you experience persistent or recurrent pain, ache, 
numbness, burning, or stiffness you should promptly see a qualified 
health care provider. These sensations may be caused by serious 
medical conditions that can be treated.

Precautions
Your computer is designed to provide optimum safety and ease of 
use, and to withstand the rigors of travel. You should observe 
certain precautions to further reduce the risk of personal injury or 
damage to the computer. 
❖ Avoid prolonged physical contact with the underside or surface 
of the computer.

--- Page 35 ---
35
Getting Started
Selecting a place to work
Never allow any liquids to spill into any part of your computer, and 
never expose the computer to rain, water, seawater or moisture. 
Exposure to liquid or moisture can cause electric shock or fire, 
resulting in damage or serious injury. If any of these eventualities 
should accidentally occur, immediately:
1. Turn off the computer.
2. Disconnect the AC adaptor from the power plug socket and 
computer.
3. Remove the battery pack.
Failure to follow these instructions could result in serious injury or 
permanent damage to the computer.
Do not turn on the power again until you have taken the computer to 
an authorized service center.
 ❖ Avoid prolonged physical contact with the underside or surface 
of the computer.
 ❖ Computer base and palm rest can become hot! Avoid prolonged 
contact to prevent heat injury to skin.
Today’s performance computers generate heat under normal 
operating conditions, as a function of system activity. Avoid 
extended contact between the computer base or palm rest and your 
skin. Under certain operating conditions such prolonged contact 
between the computer base or palm rest and your skin may result in 
skin irritation and/or heat injury.
Consider using a hard computer insulating pad or similarly suitable 
hard insulating material when using a computer on your lap.
Never place a heavy object on the computer and be careful not to 
drop a heavy object onto the computer. It could damage the 
computer or cause system failure.
❖ Never turn off the computer if a drive light indicates a drive is active.
Turning off the computer while it is reading from or writing to 
a disk/disc or flash media may damage the disk/disc or flash 
media, the drive, or both.

--- Page 36 ---
36
Getting Started
Selecting a place to work
❖ Keep the computer and disks away from objects that generate 
strong magnetic fields, such as large stereo speakers.
Information on some disks is stored magnetically. Placing a 
magnet too close to a disk can erase important files.
Handle discs carefully. Avoid touching the surface of the disc. Grasp 
it by its center hole and edge. If you handle the disc incorrectly, you 
could damage the disc and possibly lose data.
❖ Scan all new files for viruses.
This precaution is especially important for files you receive via 
email or download from the Internet. Occasionally, even new 
programs you buy from a supplier may contain a computer 
virus. You need a special program to check for viruses.
Important information on your computer’s cooling fan
Your computer may have a CPU cooling fan that cools the CPU by 
drawing outside air into the computer.
Always make sure your computer and AC adaptor have adequate 
ventilation and are protected from overheating when the power is turned 
on or when an AC adaptor is connected to a power outlet (even if your 
computer is in Sleep mode). In this condition, observe the following:
 ❖ Never cover your computer or AC adaptor with any object.
 ❖ Never place your computer or AC adaptor near a heat source, 
such as an electric blanket or heater.
 ❖ Never cover or block the air vents including those located at the 
underside of the computer.
 ❖ Always operate your computer on a hard flat surface. Using your 
computer on a carpet or other soft material can block the vents 
located at the underside of the computer.
Overheating your computer or AC adaptor could cause system 
failure, computer or AC adaptor damage or a fire, possibly resulting 
in serious injury.
The cooling fan location will vary depending on the computer.

(AC adaptor connected)
❖ Glows white when the main battery is fully charged
❖ Is unlit when the main battery has discharged, the battery 
is not charging, or the AC adaptor is not plugged into the 
computer or AC outlet
❖ Flashes amber when the main battery charge is low and it 
is time to recharge the main battery or plug in the AC 
adaptor
If the AC power light flashes amber during charging, either the main 
battery is malfunctioning, or it is not receiving correct input from the

Charging the main battery
The computer battery may not be accessible by the user.
Before using the battery to power the computer, you must charge 
the battery.
To charge the battery, leave the computer plugged into an AC power 
source with the computer turned off until the battery light glows 
white. After that, the battery will be completely charged and ready 
to power the computer.
Battery life and charge time may vary depending on the applications 
power management settings, and features used.
Using the computer for the first time
The computer is now ready for you to turn it on and begin using it, 
see “Exploring Your Computer’s Features” on page 100.
When opening or closing the display panel, place one hand on the 
palm rest to hold the computer in place and use the other hand to 
slowly open or close the display panel.
To avoid damaging the display panel, do not force it beyond the point 
where it moves easily and never lift the computer by the display 
panel. 
Do not press or push on the display panel and be careful to remove 
any pens or other objects from the keyboard area before closing the 
display panel.
Small bright dots may appear on your screen display when you 
turn on your computer. Your display contains an extremely large 
number of thin-film transistors (TFT) and is manufactured using 
high-precision technology. Any small bright dots that may appear 
on your display are an intrinsic characteristic of the TFT 
manufacturing technology. Over a period of time, and depending on 
the usage of the computer, the brightness of the screen will 
deteriorate. This is also an intrinsic characteristic of the screen 
technology. When the computer is operated on battery power, the 
screen will dim and you may not be able to increase the brightness 
of the screen while on battery power.

Chapter 2
Learning the Basics
This chapter gives some computing tips and provides important 
information about basic features.
Computing tips
❖ Save your work frequently.
Your work stays in the computer’s temporary memory until 
you save it to the internal storage drive. If the network you are 
using goes down and you must restart your computer to 
reconnect, or your battery runs out of charge while you are 
working, you will lose all work since you last saved.
See “Saving your work” on page 78 for further information.
HINT: Some programs have an automatic save feature that can be 
activated. This feature saves your file to the internal storage drive at 
preset intervals. See your software documentation for details.

--- Page 73 ---
73
Learning the Basics
Using the keyboard
❖ Back up your files to external media on a regular basis. Label 
the backup copies clearly and store them in a safe place.
It is easy to put off backing up because it takes time. However, 
if your internal storage drive suddenly fails, you will lose all 
the data on it unless you have a separate backup copy. For more 
information, see “Data and system configuration backup in the 
Windows® operating system” on page 145.
❖ Use Error-checking and Disk Defragmenter regularly to check 
and optimize disk space and improve performance. 
❖ Scan all new files for viruses.
This precaution is especially important for files you receive via 
external media, email, or download from the Internet. 
❖ Take frequent breaks to avoid repetitive-motion injuries and 
eyestrain.
❖ Do not turn off the computer if a drive indicator light indicates 
a drive is active.
Turning off the computer while it is reading from or writing to 
a disk may damage the disk, the drive, or both.
The Windows
®
 operating system records information, such as your 
desktop setup, during its shutdown procedure. If you do not let the 
Windows
®
 operating system shut down normally, details such as 
new icon positions may be lost.
Using the keyboard
Your computer may be equipped with a 10-key keyboard, depending 
on your model.
Your computer’s keyboard contains character keys, control keys, 
function keys, and special Windows
®
 keys.

Saving your work
Saving your work
Before you turn off the computer using the Shut down command, 
save your work on the internal storage drive, external media, flash 
media, or optical disc. This is one of the most important rules of 
computing.
Many applications offer a feature that saves documents at regular 
intervals. Check your program’s documentation to see if it has an 
automatic save feature.
Backing up your work
Back up all the files you create in case something happens to your 
computer. You can back up your files to different types of media 
such as CDs, DVDs, external storage media, or to a network, if 
available.
To back up several files at one time, use the Microsoft
®
 Windows
®
 
file recovery program preinstalled on the computer’s internal 
storage drive. Also see “Backing up your data or your entire 
computer with the Windows® operating system” on page 147.
HINT: Backing up all the files on your internal storage drive may take 
a considerable amount of time and multiple CDs/DVDs. You may 
prefer to use a high-capacity file recovery system, such as an 
external hard drive.
Using the optical disc drive
Optical storage is a popular medium for software, music, and video. 
Digital versatile discs (DVDs) provide a significant increase in data 
storage and support features that were not available on previous 
video platforms. These features include wide-screen movies, 
multiple language tracks, digital surround sound, multiple camera 
angles, and interactive menus.
TECHNICAL NOTE: Your optical disc drive is set to play region 1 
(North America) DVD-ROMs. If you play a DVD disc from another 
region, the drive will automatically change to play in the format of the 
other region. The drive will allow you to change regions four times. 
On the fourth change, the region will be “locked in.” That is, the drive 
will only play DVDs from that last region. Note that changing from 
region 1 to region 2 and back to region 1 is counted as two changes.

Chapter 3
Mobile Computing
This chapter covers all aspects of using your computer while 
traveling.
Toshiba’s energy-saver design
Your computer enters a low-power suspension mode when it is not 
being used, thereby conserving energy and saving money in the 
process. It has a number of other features that enhance its energy 
efficiency.
Many of these energy-saving features have been preset by Toshiba. 
We recommend you leave these features active, allowing your 
computer to operate at its maximum energy efficiency, so that you 
can use it for longer periods while traveling.
Running the computer on battery power
The computer contains a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery that provides 
power when you are away from an AC outlet. You can recharge it 
many times.

--- Page 85 ---

Mobile Computing
Running the computer on battery power
Battery Notice
Battery life rating is for comparison purposes only, and does not 
indicate the battery life that will be obtained by any individual user. 
Actual battery life may vary considerably from specifications 
depending on product model, configuration, applications, power 
management settings and features utilized, as well as the natural 
performance variations produced by the design of individual 
components. The battery life rating is only achieved on the select 
models and configurations tested by Toshiba under the specific test 
settings at the time of publication and is not an estimate of a 
system’s battery life under any conditions other than the specific 
test settings. 
Recharge time varies depending on usage. Battery may not charge 
while the computer is consuming full power. After a period of time, 
the battery will lose its ability to perform at maximum capacity and 
will need to be replaced. This is normal for all batteries.
To ensure that the battery maintains its maximum capacity, 
operate the computer on battery power at least once a month. The 
Lithium-Ion battery has no memory effect so it is not necessary to 
let the battery fully discharge each time. However, for better 
accuracy of the battery meter, it is helpful to fully discharge the 
battery periodically. Please see “Maintaining your battery” on 
page 97 for procedures. If the computer is continuously operated on 
AC power, either through an AC adaptor or a port replicator (if 
applicable to your system), for an extended period (more than a 
month), the battery may fail to retain a charge. This may shorten the

TECHNICAL NOTE: The recharging of the battery may not occur when 
your computer is using all of the power provided by the AC adaptor to 
run applications, features, and devices. Your computer's Power Options 
utility can be used to select a power level setting that reduces the power 
required for system operation and will allow the battery to recharge.
The battery may not start charging immediately under the following 
conditions:
❖ The battery is extremely hot or cold. 
To ensure that the battery charges to its full capacity, wait until 
it reaches room temperature (50 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 to 
26 degrees Celsius).
❖ The battery is almost completely discharged. 
Leave the power connected and the battery should begin 
charging after a few minutes.
HINT: Once the battery is fully charged, we recommend that you 
periodically operate your computer on battery power until the battery 
discharges completely.
Please make a complete back up of your data to external media 
before discharging the battery. For more information, see “Backing

Mobile Computing
Monitoring battery power
To recharge the RTC battery, plug the computer into a live electrical 
outlet and leave the computer powered on for 24 hours.
It is seldom necessary to charge the RTC battery because it charges 
while the computer is on. If the RTC battery is low, the real-time 
clock and calendar may display the incorrect time and date or stop 
working.
When Hibernation mode is enabled and the RTC battery is 
completely discharged, a warning prompts you to reset the real-time 
clock.
The computer can be used while the RTC battery is being charged, 
although the charging status of the RTC battery cannot be 
monitored.
Monitoring battery power
The computer’s main battery light gives you an indication of the

❖ Plug the computer into an external power source and recharge 
the main battery
❖ Place the computer into Hibernation mode and replace the 
battery with a charged spare (not included with your computer)
❖ Save your work and turn off the computer
If you do not manage to do any of these things before the main 
battery completely runs out of power, the computer automatically 
enters Hibernation mode and turns itself off. Hibernation mode 
keeps track of where you were, so that when you turn on the power 
again, you can continue where you left off. 
Setting battery notifications
You can set two notifications. Each notification can be set to alert 
you when a specified percentage of remaining battery power has 
been reached. You can also set the computer to enter Sleep mode or

Disposing of used batteries
Disposing of used batteries
The life of a battery pack depends on usage. When the battery pack 
needs replacing, the battery light flashes amber shortly after you 
have fully recharged the battery. 
You must discard a battery if it becomes damaged.
Never attempt to dispose of a computer by burning or by throwing it 
into a fire, and never allow exposure to a heating apparatus (e.g., 
microwave oven). Heat can cause a computer to explode and/or 
release caustic liquid, both which may possibly cause serious injury.
Always dispose of used battery packs in compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. Put insulating tape, such as 
cellophane tape, on the electrode during transportation to avoid a 
possible short circuit, fire or electric shock. Failure to do so could 
possibly result in serious injury.
Always use the battery pack supplied as an accessory or an 
equivalent battery pack specified in the User's Manual. Other 
battery packs have different voltage and terminal polarities. Use of 
non-conforming battery packs could generate smoke or cause fire or 
rupture, possibly resulting in serious injury.
After repeated use, the batteries will finally lose their ability to hold 
a charge and you will need to replace them. Under certain 
applicable laws and regulations, it may be illegal to dispose of old 
batteries by placing them in the trash.
Please be kind to our shared environment. Check with your local 
government authority for details regarding where to recycle old 
batteries or how to dispose of them properly. 
In addition, Toshiba’s recycling initiatives include recycling 
programs, events and consumer promotions. For details, please visit

Password Utility
Password Utility
Setting a password lets you walk away from your computer while 
providing additional protection for your files. When you set a 
password, you must enter the password before you can work on 
your computer again.
TOSHIBA supports different types of passwords on your computer:
❖ A supervisor password—Prohibits unauthorized users from 
accessing certain functions such as System Settings. This is 
useful if more than one person uses the computer. 
❖ A user password—Prevents unauthorized users from starting 
the computer.
When setting up passwords, keep the following in mind:
❖ The supervisor password must be set before the user password, 
or the user password must be deleted and then re-entered after 
the supervisor password is set.
❖ The user password can be set up under the supervisor 
password.
Using a supervisor password
A supervisor password prevents other users from changing 
hardware configuration options.
Setting a supervisor password
If you choose to set a supervisor or user password, TOSHIBA 
strongly recommends that you save your password in a location 
where you can later access it should you not remember it.
TOSHIBA is not responsible for any losses that may occur to you, your 
organization or others as a result of the inability to access your 
computer.

Chapter 6
If Something Goes Wrong
Some problems you may encounter when using your computer are 
relatively easy to identify and solve. Others may require help from 
your network administrator or the manufacturer of the software 
program.
This chapter aims to help you solve many problems by yourself. It 
covers the problems you are most likely to encounter.
If all else fails, contact Toshiba. You will find information on 
Toshiba’s support services at the end of this chapter. 
Problems that are easy to fix
Your program or application stops responding.
The Windows 8 operating system allows for the use of both 
applications (“Apps” used with the Windows
®
 “Modern UI”) and 
programs (used in the traditional Windows
®
 desktop environment). 
For the purpose of simplifying the information we will use the terms 
interchangeably in this chapter.
If you are working in a program that suddenly freezes, chances are 
the program has stopped responding. You can exit the program 
without shutting down the operating system or closing other 
programs.
NOTE

--- Page 126 ---
126
If Something Goes Wrong
Problems when you turn on the computer
To close a program that has stopped responding:
1 Press 
Ctrl, Alt, and Del simultaneously (once), and then click or 
touch Task Manager.
The Task Manager window appears.
2 Select the program or application you want to close, and then 
click or touch End Task in the lower right corner.
Closing the failed program should allow you to continue 
working. If it does not, continue with the next step.
3 Close the remaining programs one by one by selecting the 
program name, then select End Task.
Closing all programs should allow you to continue working. If 
it does not, power off your computer, and then restart it.
Problems when you turn on the computer
These problems may occur when you turn on the power.
The computer will not start.
Make sure you attached the AC adaptor and power cord/cable 
properly.
Press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds.
If you are using the AC adaptor, check that the wall outlet is 
working by plugging in another device, such as a lamp.
Verify that the computer is on by looking at the Power button. If the 
button is glowing, the computer is on. If the button is not lit, try 
turning the computer off and then on again.
If you are using an AC adaptor, verify that the computer is receiving 
power from the external power source by checking the AC power 
light located on the left side of the computer. If the indicator is 
glowing, the computer is connected to a live external power source.
The computer displays the WARNING RESUME FAILURE/Windows Error 
Recovery – Windows did not shut down successfully
 message.
To continue, select Start Windows normally. This can happen if 
the computer was put into Sleep mode and the battery has 
discharged. If you performed a shutdown before this message was 
displayed, a program or driver may have prevented Windows
®
 from 
shutting down.
Data stored in the computer’s memory has been lost. Data stored in 
the computer’s internal storage drive may not be affected.

--- Page 127 ---
127
If Something Goes Wrong
Problems when you turn on the computer
Always save your data even when you are using Sleep mode. If 
your battery fully discharges, information that has not been saved 
will be lost. Your computer can be configured to warn you when the 
battery is running low see “What to do when the main battery runs 
low” on page 90. 
If you are running on battery power, it is recommended that you do 
not leave the computer in Sleep mode for long periods of time.
To charge the battery, leave the computer plugged into a live wall 
outlet for several hours. For more information see “Charging the 
main battery” on page 86. 
The AC power light is blinking.
If the AC power light is blinking, try the following steps:
1 Connect the AC adaptor to a different power outlet, preferably 
in a different room. If the computer starts normally, there may 
be a problem with the AC outlet itself, or the voltage level 
available from it.
2 Verify that the AC adaptor is the correct unit for your computer 
model. The computer may not be able to start from an AC 
adaptor that is rated for less current (amperage) than the 
computer requires, even if the rated voltage is correct, and the 
plug fits correctly in the DC-IN socket. The labels on the 
bottom of the computer and the AC adaptor show the 
specifications for voltage (“V”) and current (“A”) for each 
device. The voltage level must match exactly. The amperage 
rating of the AC adaptor must be equal to or greater than that 
required by the computer.
3 If your computer has a removable battery, connect the AC 
adaptor to the computer. Leave the battery out of the computer. 
Try turning the computer on again. 
If the computer starts normally, the battery may need 
charging, may be depleted, or may be defective. Turn the 
computer off, insert the battery, turn the computer on, and then 
leave the computer running for several hours, which will 
deliver a slow, steady “trickle-charge” to the battery. Once the 
battery has been trickle-charged, it may begin working 
correctly again. 
If the trickle-charging does not prove effective, you can connect to 
Support Online by going to Toshiba support at support.toshiba.com.

If Something Goes Wrong
The Windows
®
 operating system is not working
The battery light is blinking when the computer is on.
If the battery light is blinking when the computer is on, this 
indicates a power mismatch. Do the following:
1 Check the OUTPUT specifications on the AC adaptor 
(for example, DC 19V – 3.95A)
2 Check the INPUT specifications on the bottom of the 
computer. 
The output specifications of the AC adaptor must match the 
input specifications of the computer. 
3 If the specifications do not match, locate and use the AC 
adaptor that shipped with your computer. If the specifications 
do match, contact Toshiba. See “Contacting Toshiba” on 
page 150. 
The Windows
® 
operating system is not working
Once you are familiar with your computer and used to the way the 
operating system responds to your work routine, you can easily 
detect if the operating system is not working correctly. For 
example:
❖ The operating system fails to start after the initial startup 
appears.
❖ The operating system takes a long time to start.
❖ The operating system responds differently from the normal 
routine.
❖ The screen does not look right.
Unless a hardware device has failed, problems usually occur when 
you change the system in some way such as installing a new 
program or adding a device.
If you experience any of these problems, use the options in the 
Startup menu to fix the problem.
Using Startup options to fix problems
If the operating system fails to start properly, you may need to 
troubleshoot the Operating System and/or its settings. There are

Power and the batteries
Power and the batteries
Your computer receives its power through the AC adaptor and 
power cord/cable or from the system batteries (battery and real-time 
clock (RTC) battery). Power problems are interrelated. For 
example, a faulty AC adaptor or power cord/cable will neither 
power the computer nor recharge the batteries.
Here are some typical problems and how to solve them:
The AC power light does not come on when you plug in the 
AC adaptor and power cord/cable.
Make sure the AC adaptor and power cord/cable are firmly plugged 
into both the wall outlet and the computer.
If the AC power light still does not come on, check that the wall 
outlet is working properly by plugging in a lamp or other appliance.
The AC adaptor and power cord/cable work correctly, but the 
battery will not charge.
The battery does not charge while the computer is consuming full 
power. Try turning off the computer.
The battery may not be inserted correctly in the computer. Turn off 
the computer, remove the battery, clean the contacts with a soft dry 
cloth (if necessary) and replace the battery. See “Removing the 
battery from the computer” on page 94.
The battery may be too hot or too cold to charge properly. If you 
think this is the probable cause, let the battery reach room 
temperature and try again.
If the battery has completely discharged, it will not begin charging 
immediately. Leave the AC adaptor and power cord/cable 
connected, wait 20 minutes and see if the battery is charging.
If the battery light is glowing after 20 minutes, let the computer 
continue charging the battery for at least another 20 minutes before 
you turn on the computer.
If the battery light does not glow after 20 minutes, the battery may 
have reached the end of its useful life.
The battery appears not to power the computer for as long as 
it usually does.
If you frequently repeat shallow charge and discharge, the battery 
meter may become inaccurate. Let the battery discharge 
completely, then try charging it again.

If Something Goes Wrong
Keyboard problems
Check the power options via your Power Plans (see “Power Plans” 
on page 92). Have you added a device that takes its power from the 
battery? Is your software using the internal storage drive more? Is 
the display power set to turn off automatically? Was the battery 
fully charged to begin with? All these conditions affect how long 
the charge lasts.
After a period of time, the battery will lose its ability to perform at 
maximum capacity and will need to be replaced. This is normal for 
all batteries. To purchase a new battery pack, see your accessories 
information included with your computer, or visit the Toshiba Web 
site at accessories.toshiba.com. Refer to this site often to stay 
current on the most recent software and hardware options for your 
computer, and for other product information.
For more information on maintaining battery power, see “Changing 
the main battery” on page 94.
Keyboard problems
To capture a print screen of the entire screen, press the 
Fn + PRTSC key.
To capture only the active window displayed, press 
Fn + ALT while 
simultaneously pressing the PRTSC key.
You have connected an external keyboard and the operating 
system displays one or more keyboard error messages.
You may need to update your keyboard driver. Refer to the 
documentation that came with the keyboard or to the keyboard

Disk or storage drive problems
The display mode is set to Simultaneous and the external 
display device does not work.
Make sure the external monitor is capable of displaying at 
resolutions of 800 x 600 or higher. Devices that do not support this 
resolution will only work in Internal/External mode, and not 
simultaneous mode.
Small bright dots appear on your TFT display when you turn 
on your computer.
Small bright dots may appear on your screen display when you 
turn on your computer. Your display contains an extremely large 
number of thin-film transistors (TFT) and is manufactured using 
high-precision technology. Any small bright dots that may appear 
on your display are an intrinsic characteristic of the TFT 
manufacturing technology. Over a period of time, and depending on 
the usage of the computer, the brightness of the screen will 
deteriorate. This is also an intrinsic characteristic of the screen 
technology. When the computer is operated on battery power, the 
screen will dim and you may not be able to increase the brightness 
of the screen while on battery power.
Disk or storage drive problems
Problems with the storage drive or with external media usually 
show up as an inability to access the drive or as sector errors. 
Sometimes a drive problem may cause one or more files to appear 
to have garbage in them.

Sound system problems
You press the disc eject button, but the drive tray does not 
slide out.
Make sure the computer is connected to a power source and turned 
on. The optical disc drive eject mechanism requires power to 
operate.
Make sure a program is not accessing the drive and preventing it 
from ejecting.
If you need to remove a disc and cannot turn on the computer (for 
example, if the battery is completely discharged), use a narrow 
object, such as a straightened paper clip, to press the manual eject 
button. This button is in the small hole next to the optical disc drive 
eject button on the face of the optical disc drive tray.
Never use a pencil to press the manual eject button. Pencil lead can 
break off inside the computer and damage it.
Some discs run correctly but others do not.
Check that the type of disc you are using is compatible with your 
optical disc drive. For more information regarding supported 
optical media formats, refer to the complete detail specifications for 
your computer at support.toshiba.com. 
If the problem is with an optical data disc, refer to the software’s 
documentation and check that the hardware configuration meets the 
program’s needs.
The disc will not come out of the drive when you click the 
eject button on the screen.
Press the button on the optical disc drive itself. For additional 
information see “You press the disc eject button, but the drive tray 
does not slide out.” on page 140.

Printer problems
The computer emits a loud, high-pitched noise.
This is feedback between the microphone and the speakers. It 
occurs in any sound system when input from a microphone is fed to 
the speakers and the speaker volume is too loud. Adjust the volume 
control.
Printer problems
This section lists some of the most common printer problems.
The printer will not print.
Check that the printer is connected to a working power outlet, 
turned on and ready (on line).
Check that the printer has plenty of paper. Some printers will not 
start printing when there are just two or three sheets of paper left in 
the tray.
Make sure the printer cable is firmly attached to the computer and 
the printer.
Run the printer’s self-test to check for any problem with the printer 
itself.
Make sure you installed the proper printer drivers as shown in the 
instructions that came with the printer.
You may have connected the printer while the computer is on. 
Disable Sleep mode, turn off the computer, and turn off the printer. 
Turn the printer back on, make sure it is online, and then turn the 
computer back on.
Try printing another file. For example, you could create and attempt 
to print a short test file using Notepad. If a Notepad file prints 
correctly, the problem may be in your original file.
If you cannot resolve the problem, contact the printer’s 
manufacturer.
The printer will not print what you see on the screen.
Many programs display information on the screen differently from 
the way they print it. See if your program has a print preview mode. 
This mode lets you see your work exactly as it will print. Contact 
the software manufacturer for more information.

Wireless networking problems
Wireless networking problems
This section provides general troubleshooting tips for networking 
problems, specifically wireless (Wi-Fi
®
) networking.
The terms and concepts used assume a basic understanding of 
networks, and may be for more advanced users. If you need 
assistance or if you are not familiar with the terminology, please see 
Windows
®
 Help and Support or contact your computer technician.
❖ If your computer is equipped with an internal Wi-Fi
®
 adapter, 
verify that Airplane mode is OFF (the wireless indicator light 
 will be lit).
❖ Verify that your computer can detect access points or routers. If 
it can detect a Wi-Fi
®
 access point or router then it may be a 
configuration issue.
❖ Verify that signal strength is good using the utility provided 
with the Wi-Fi
®
 adapter.
❖ If another computer is on the same network, verify that it has 
network access, and can connect to the Internet. If, for 
example, the other computer cannot browse to a public Web 
site, the ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) service may be 
disrupted.
❖ Verify that the Service Set Identifier (SSID), or network 
name, is correct 
- i.e., that it matches the SSID assigned to the 
access point you are attempting to connect through. SSIDs are 
case-sensitive. 
❖ Check the Windows
®
 Control Panel's Device Manager to verify 
that the Wi-Fi
®
 adapter is recognized by the Windows
®
 
operating system, and that the driver is loaded. To access 
the Device Manager, from the Start screen begin typing 
Computer. If you are in the Desktop screen, move your 
pointer to the upper-right corner of the screen or swipe in from 
the right edge. When the Windows
®
 charms appear click or 
touch the Search ( ) charm, and then type Computer. Click 
or touch Control Panel, System and Security, and then 
System. Carefully note any error messages 
- these will be very 
helpful if you should confer with a support technician at a later 
time.
To enable or disable wireless communication, use the F12 key. For 
more information see “TOSHIBA Function Keys” on page 152.

DVD operating problems
❖ Use IPCONFIG to verify that the computer has a useful IP 
address 
- one other than the private address of 
169.254.xxx.xxx assigned by Windows
®
.
1 From the Start screen, type 
Cmd.
2 Click Command Prompt.
3 Enter 
IPCONFIG/ALL, and then press ENTER.
The IP address for each active network adapter will be 
displayed.
❖ Connect your computer directly to your router or broadband 
modem, by plugging a standard CAT5 Ethernet patch cable 
(sold separately) into your computer's RJ45 Ethernet port. If 
your connection problem disappears, the problem lies in the 
Wi-Fi
®
 part of your network.
❖ If you have enabled any security provisions (closed system, 
MAC address filtering, Wired Equivalent Privacy [WEP], etc.), 
check the access point vendor's Web site for recent firmware 
upgrades. Problems with WEP keys, in particular, are 
frequently addressed in new firmware releases.
DVD operating problems
If you experience a problem playing DVDs, you may be able to fix 
the problem yourself. 
For general problems playing a DVD title, try the following steps:
1 Verify that the disc is in a format that the drive supports.
2 Ensure that the disc is properly inserted in the drive tray.
3 Use the DVD Player software that came with your computer to view 
DVD movies.
4 Clean the disc and try again.
A dirty drive can also cause audio problems. If you have tried 
several discs and all fail, consider sending your drive to an 
authorized service provider to get it cleaned.
5 From the Start screen, type Computer. Click or touch 
Computer from the list that appears. 
The optical disc drive should appear in the list.
6 See “Checking device properties” on page 132 for instructions 
on using Device Manager to view the optical disc drive 
properties.

Save your work frequently.
You can never predict when your computer will lock, forcing you to 
close a program and lose unsaved changes. Many software 
programs build in an automatic backup, but you should not rely 
solely on this feature. Save your work! See “Computing tips” on 
page 72 for instructions.

If Something Goes Wrong
Develop good computing habits
On a regular basis, back up the information stored on your 
internal storage drive.
Use Windows
®
 to back up files, or the entire computer, to an optical 
disc, or external hard disk. Here are some ways you can do this:
❖ Use the Windows
®
 operating system to back up files or your 
entire computer to an optical disc, or external hard disk.
❖ Copy files to a rewritable external storage device.
❖ Connect your computer to the office network and copy files to 
your network partition.
Some people use a combination of these methods, backing up all 
files weekly and copying critical files to external media on a daily 
basis.
If you have installed your own programs, you should back up these 
programs as well as your data files. If something goes wrong that 
requires you to reformat your internal storage drive and start again, 
reloading all your programs and data files from a backup source 
will save time.
Read the documentation.
It is very difficult to provide a fail-safe set of steps you can follow 
every time you experience a problem with the computer. Your 
ability to solve problems will improve as you learn about how the 
computer and its software work together.
Get familiar with all of the documentation provided with your 
computer, as well as the information that may come with the 
programs and devices you purchase.
Your local computer store or book store sells a variety of self-help 
books you can use to supplement the information in the manuals.
Data and system configuration backup in the Windows
®
 operating 
system
The Windows
®
 operating system offers some easy-to-use features 
for backing up your Windows
®
 settings and your data - documents 
and other important files. Take advantage of these features to 
protect yourself from much more difficult and time-consuming 
restoration procedures, and to safeguard your valuable data from 
loss.

Saving system configuration with restore points
The System Restore feature of the Windows
®
 operating system 
quickly creates restore points 
- ‘snapshots’ of your Windows
®
 
operating system configuration 
- and saves them for later recall. If 
you experience problems after installing some new hardware or 
software, you can easily select a previously established Control 
Point to ‘turn back the clock,’ restoring the Windows
®
 operating 
system to the state it was in just prior to the installation. This is 
much easier and more effective than uninstalling the hardware or 
software, which often leaves behind unwanted files and settings. It 
is also easy to undo a restore point selection, if you change your 
mind.
Follow these steps to create a restore point using the System 
Restore utility:
1 From the Start screen, type Control. Click or touch Control 
Panel from the list that appears.
2 Click or touch System and Security, and then System.
3 In the left pane, click or touch System Protection.
The System Protection tab of the System Properties window 
appears.
4 Click or touch Configure.
5 Under Restore settings select Turn on System Protection.
6 Click or touch OK.
7 Click or touch Create.
8 In the input field, enter a name that is descriptive enough to be 
easily understood in the future, such as “Before installing 
Brand X Accounting app.” Then click or touch Create.
The Windows
®
 operating system creates the restore point, 
automatically stamps it with the current date and time, and 
displays a message that the restore point was successfully 
created. 
9 Click or touch Close.
Then, at a later time, you can re-establish your Windows
®
 
configuration using the saved restore point. To do this:
1 From the Start screen, type Control. Click or touch Control 
Panel from the list that appears.
2 Click or touch System and Security, and then System.

3 In the left pane, click or touch System Protection.
The System Protection tab of the System Properties window 
appears.
4 Click or touch System Restore...
5 Click or touch Next.
6 Click or touch the Restore point you want to use then click or 
touch Next.
The time stamp and description of each Restore point is 
displayed.
At this point you can click or touch “Scan for affected programs” to 
determine what the impact of using the chosen Restore Point will be.
7 Verify that the Restore point you chose is the correct one. If it 
is not, click or touch Back to return to the previous step.
8 Close all programs and save all open files.
9 Click or touch Finish, and then Yes to begin the system restore.
Your Windows
®
 operating system configuration will now be 
restored to the state it was in when the chosen restore point was 
created, and then the computer will be automatically restarted.
Backing up your data or your entire computer with the 
Windows
®
 operating system
The most valuable component of your computer system is the data 
you create and store on its internal storage drive. Since problems 
with either hardware or software can make the data inaccessible or 
even destroy it, the next most valuable component of your computer 
system may be a recent backup of your data.
Fortunately, the Windows
®
 operating system offers a convenient 
way to back up your computer or just your important files to optical 
disc drives, or hard drives. An external hard drive is recommended 
in case the internal storage drive fails. No additional software is 
required. Most of the optical disc drives built into recent Toshiba 
portable computer models can write to (or ‘burn’) as well as read 
from optical discs. External optical disc writers are also widely 
available.
NOTE

If Something Goes Wrong
Develop good computing habits
Follow these steps to back up your computer or files to optical 
discs, or a storage drive:
You cannot back up the computer while running on battery power. 
Connect the AC adaptor before continuing.
1 From the Start screen, type Control. Click or touch Control 
Panel from the list that appears.
2 Click or touch Save backup copies of your files with File 
History under the System and Security heading. Follow the 
on-screen instructions to back up your files.
For additional Help, while in the Windows
®
 Desktop screen, press 
the 
F1 key to launch the Windows
®
 Help and Support screen. Search 
for “back up files”.
General tips for installing hardware and software
Here are a few tips to help ensure safe and easy installation of new 
hardware (printers, pointing devices, external hard drives, optical 
disc drive writers, scanners, etc.) and software (applications like 
Microsoft
®
 Office and Adobe
®
 Photoshop
®
, or utility software such 
as special toolbars for your web browser). 
❖ Create a restore point (refer to “Saving system configuration 
with restore points” on page 146). Before installing anything, 
use the System Restore utility to set a restore point (see the 
section titled restore points). If anything goes wrong, you will 
then be able to easily restore the Windows
®
 operating system to 
the state it was in prior to the installation, undoing any changes 
that the installation process introduced.
❖ Back up your critical data (see “Backing up your data or your 
entire computer with the Windows® operating system” on 
page 147).
❖ Have your back up DVD(s) on hand in case you need any files 
from them. 
❖ Do not guess 
- follow directions carefully! It is often necessary 
to run an installation utility first 
- before connecting a new 
hardware item to the computer. If the device is connected first, 
it may be very difficult to complete the installation 
successfully. Always carefully follow the installation 
instructions that accompany the hardware or software.
NOTE

--- Page 149 ---
149
If Something Goes Wrong
If you need further assistance
❖ Restart the Windows
®
 operating system. Always restart the 
Windows
®
 operating system after each installation, even if the 
installation utility does not prompt you to do so. This will 
ensure that the installation is completed, and will clean up 
anything that the installation utility left behind.
❖ Do one installation at a time. If you have several new items to 
add to your computer system, install just one at a time, creating 
restore points immediately before each successive installation. 
This will make it much easier to determine the origin of any 
new problems. For best results, follow this sequence:
1 Back up critical data.
2 Create a restore point.
3 Install one item of hardware or software.
4 Restart the Windows
®
 operating system.
5 Use the new hardware or software for a while, noting any 
new problems. Make sure that your critical applications 
(email, business applications, etc.) are working correctly, 
and verify that important devices are still functioning.
6 For each additional hardware or software item, repeat 
these steps, starting at step 1 if any of your critical data has 
changed, or starting at step 2 if no critical data has 
changed.
If you need further assistance
If you have followed the recommendations in this chapter and are 
still having problems, you may need additional technical assistance. 
Since some problems may be related to the operating system or the 
program you are using, it is important to investigate all sources.
❖ Review the troubleshooting information in your operating 
system documentation.
❖ If the problem occurs while you are running a program, consult 
the program’s documentation for troubleshooting suggestions. 
Contact the software company’s technical support group for 
their assistance.
❖ Consult the dealer from whom you purchased your computer 
and/or program. Your dealer is your best source for current 
information.

The following terms may appear in this User’s Guide.
A
active-matrix display—A liquid crystal display (LCD) made from an 
array of liquid crystal cells using active-matrix technology. Also 
known as a “TFT display,” in its simplest form there is one thin film 
transistor (TFT) for each cell. This type of display works well with 
computers because of its shallow depth and high-quality color. 
Active-matrix displays are viewable from wider angles than most 
passive-matrix displays.
adapter—A device that provides a compatible connection between two 
units. For example, the computer’s internal display adapter receives 
information from the software and translates it into images on the
