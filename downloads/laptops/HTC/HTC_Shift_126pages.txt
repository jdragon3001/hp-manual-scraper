Safety precautions for RF exposure
•  Use only original manufacturer-approved accessories, or accessories that do not 
contain any metal.
•  Use of non-original manufacturer-approved accessories may violate your local RF 
exposure guidelines and should be avoided.
Exposure to Radio Frequency (RF) Signals
The wireless device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed and manufactured 
not to exceed the emission limits for exposure to radio frequency (RF) energy. The 
exposure standard for wireless equipments employs a unit of measurement known as 
the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The standard incorporates a substantial margin 
of safety to give additional protection for the public and to account for any variations 
in usage.

Pacemakers 
The Health Industry Manufacturers Association recommends that a minimum 
separation of six inches be maintained between a handheld wireless phone 
and a pacemaker to avoid potential interference with the pacemaker. These 
recommendations are consistent with the independent research by and 
recommendations of Wireless Technology Research. Persons with pacemakers:
•  Should ALWAYS keep the phone more than six inches from their pacemaker when 
the phone is turned ON. 
•  Should not carry the phone in a breast pocket. 
•  Should use the ear opposite the pacemaker to minimize the potential for 
interference. If you have any reason to suspect that interference is taking place, 
turn the phone OFF immediately. 
Hearing Aids 
Some digital wireless phones may interfere with some hearing aids. In the event of 
such interference, you may want to consult your service provider, or call the customer 
service line to discuss alternatives.
Other Medical Devices 
If you use any other personal medical device, consult the manufacturer of your device 
to determine if they are adequately shielded from external RF energy. Your physician 
may be able to assist you in obtaining this information.
Turn the device OFF in health care facilities when any regulations posted in these areas 
instruct you to do so. Hospitals or health care facilities may be using equipment that 
could be sensitive to external RF energy.
