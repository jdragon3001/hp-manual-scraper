Building a personal area network
  [PAN]
You can use the PAN profile to build a network of Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-enabled devices.
→Operating as a server
→Operating as a client
A personal area network comprises a client-server architecture. The device to which other devices connect is called the "server", and a device that
connects to the server is called a "client."
The client-server relationship is not necessarily a fixed one. The first of two devices to establish a connection can be the server when one other
device is present, and can be the client in other instances.
Note

The maximum total number of devices that can be used to constitute a single personal area network is seven: one server and six clients.
A network comprising as many as seven devices could theoretically be built, but an operating environment that involves the use of other
Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices, leaving aside other complications, might require the network to comprise fewer components..
By using the PAN profile, you will be able to build a network that uses the same TCP/IP protocol used in regular LANs. Accordingly, the machine
designated as the server can be used for configuration tasks that utilize DHCP, such as assigning IP addresses to clients.
In addition, you will be able to configure folder and file sharing, which will allow data to be browsed by other servers or clients on the network.
　　　　
Page 668

--- Page 669 ---
Important

Please refer to Windows Help for further information on TCP/IP, DHCP and configurations for sharing.
Operating as a server
The following icon will appear in the tasktray when the PAN server function has been activated.
Should the icon not appear, please follow the procedure below to activate the PAN server function.
1. Right-click the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray and make sure the [service property] of Option [Use PAN
Group Ad-hoc Network] is checked. 
A message will appear asking you to confirm whether you wish to activate the PAN group ad-hoc network. 
2. Click the [Yes] button 
The PAN server will be activated, and an icon will accordingly appear in the tasktray. Other devices that use the PAN profile will now
be able to connect over the network. 
Important

When using the device as the server, make sure that all user accounts have a password set for the security reasons. 

The IP address of the server is automatically set up when it starts. Please do not change this IP address. 

When the device starts as the server, it starts the DHCP server function. We recommend that you should use the IP addresses provided
from this DHCP server for the clients connected. Please do not change these IP addresses. 
By clicking on the icon, the [Bluetooth PAN Server] window will appear. 
In the graphic below, one client has established a connection.
Page 669

--- Page 670 ---
Note

When you try to connect to another server as a client, the task tray icon will disappear, and your machine will not be able to function as a
server in response to connection requests originating from other devices.

During server starting, it is not possible to stop the DHCP server. 
Operating as a client
Connecting to a server as a client is performed from the [Bluetooth Settings] window, as described below.
Procedure
1. Right-click on the Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology icon in the task tray, and click on [Add New Connection]

Glossary
This glossary provides definitions for Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology-related terminology.
You will be able to look up the meanings of any uncertain terms here.
A2DP Profile 
Abbreviation of Advanced Audio Distribution.
A profile allowing you to adjust the sound quality of wireless headsets and other audio devices. 
 
AVRCP Profile 
Abbreviation of Audio/Video Remote Control Profile. A profile enabling remote control functions to be sent and received. Remote control
commands can be received by the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility. 
 
DHCP 
Abbreviation of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DHCP is a function that automatically sets up IP addresses. This function will allow you to avoid having to set up IP addresses on each computer.  
 
DUN Profile 
A profile for Dial-up Networking.
This profile enables you to establish a dial-up Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology connection with a wireless modem station, mobile telephone, or
other similar device.
 
FAX Profile 
A profile that enables you to establish a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology connection with a wireless modem station, mobile telephone, or other
similar device to send or receive a fax. 
 
FTP 
Abbreviation of File Transfer Profile. 
A profile that enables you to browse folders on a wireless device and transfer files to and from the local device.

GAVDP Profile 
Abbreviation of Generic Audio-Video Distribution Profile. 
 
HCRP 
Abbreviation of Hardcopy Cable Replacement Profile. Unlike SPP (Serial Port Profile), this profile only establishes a connection to a device when
you print. 
 
HID Profile 
Abbreviation of Human Interface Device Profile. 
A profile that enables you to establish a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology connection with a wireless mouse, keyboard, or other input device. 
 
LAP 
Abbreviation of LAN Access Profile. 
A profile that enables you to establish a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology connection to a LAN access point to access a LAN via PPP. 
 
OPP 
Abbreviation of Object Push Profile. 
A profile that enables you to exchange business cards with a wireless device. 
 
Passkey
Also known as a PIN code
This is a password consisting of up to 16 alphanumeric characters that enables a connection to be established to a wireless device. You need to
know the passkey in order to connect to a device that requires authentication.
Even when the authentication setting has been disabled in the User Mode settings of the Bluetooth
TM
 Utility, the passkey entry dialog box will
automatically appear if authentication is required, enabling you to authenticate a device. A link key will automatically be created once you have
authenticated a device, eliminating the need for a passkey to connect to that device in the future..

Pairing
A security function. In order for Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology devices to authenticate each other, a passkey (PIN code) is entered in each
terminal when they are connected for the first time, and a secret 128-bit link key is generated. This action is known as "pairing."
 
Profile 
A specification that guarantees the connection to the service function of a remote Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology device.
For a device to send and receive information to and from another device, both devices must support shared profiles designated for each function,
such as dial-up networking, faxing, printing and human interface devices. 
 
SCMS-T
One of the digital content copyright protection methods used for transmission with A2DP Profile. This method is based on SCMS (Serial Copy
Management System), a digital copy generation management system, and has been authorized by Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group). In order
to use the SCMS-T feature, the remote devices must also support SCMS-T.
 
SPP 
Abbreviation of Serial Port Profile.
A profile that enables communication with a device through a virtual serial port configured for a Bluetooth
TM
 wireless technology connection. This
profile can be used for printers and printer adapters with PDAs, using a method different from HCRP or ActiveSync.. 
 
TCP/IP 
Abbreviation of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
Standard communications protocol (convention for enabling data communication) used by the Internet. Using the same protocol enables
computers to exchange data with each other. 
 
 
vCARD 
Common standard for electronic business cards.
Names, (e)mail addresses, telephone numbers and other information are exchanged in the form of electronic business cards (in *.vcf format),
allowing all parties to easily register each other's data in their address books.
The standard is extensively compatible with Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Organizer and other mail/schedule management software.
