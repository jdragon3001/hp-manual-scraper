Devices situated in locations beyond the reach of the radio waves will not recognize each other, which will make communication impossible.
In particular, please ensure that your devices are located close enough so that they can communicate with each other before you initially register

PCs have a communication distance restriction of ten meters. Please refer to the instruction manuals for information on the communication

Communication interference may occur if any obstructions are located between the devices. Devices may not communicate properly if they
have been located, for example, on the ground and first floors of a residence, despite their being within the acceptable distance.
In certain devices, simply turning on the power will not produce a connectable state. Moreover, the energy-saving feature may come into effect
after a certain amount of time, which will prevent the devices frombeing detected. Please refer to the specific product instruction manual for further

It is important to understand the concepts of "services" and "profiles" in order to determine whether an intended function can be properly utilized
TM
TM
wireless technology devices include mice and keyboards (input devices), printers (output devices), and wireless modems
(communication devices). Functions that can be utilized by such devices are called "services."
TM
For example, when a PC makes a connection to a device, it obtains the profile of the corresponding device and thereby ascertains which functions
As an example, imagine someone who travels overseas.
The traveller is only able to converse properly with their counterpart if both speak a language (English, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) they both
In the above example, the traveller and his/her counterpart correspond to the devices, the languages to the profiles, and the dialogues between the
two people to the services. The former example refers to a situation where a service can be performed because the devices support a common
profile, whereas the latter example refers to a situation where a service cannot be performed because a common profile is not supported.

If the profiles belonging to the device are not supported by the PC, the functions corresponding to those profiles will not be able to be utilized.
