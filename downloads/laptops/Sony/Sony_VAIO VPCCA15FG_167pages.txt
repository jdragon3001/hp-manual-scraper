Ergonomic Considerations
Ergonomic Considerations
You will be using your computer as a portable device in a variety of environments. Whenever possible, you should attempt 
to take account of the following ergonomic considerations for both stationary and portable environments:
❑ Position of your computer – Place the computer directly in front of you. Keep your forearms horizontal, with your wrists 
in a neutral, comfortable position while using the keyboard or the pointing device. Let your upper arms hang naturally at 
your sides. Take frequent breaks while using your computer. Excessive use of the computer may strain eyes, muscles, or 
tendons.
❑ Furniture and posture – Sit in a chair with good back support. Adjust the level of the chair so your feet are flat on the 
floor. A footrest may make you more comfortable. Sit in a relaxed, upright posture and avoid slouching forward or leaning 
far backwards.

Ergonomic Considerations
❑ Viewing angle of the computer display – Use the display tilting feature to find the best position. You can reduce eye 
strain and muscle fatigue by adjusting the tilt of the display to the proper position. Adjust the brightness level of the display 
as well.
❑ Lighting – Choose a location where windows and lights do not cause glare and reflection on the display. Use indirect 
lighting to avoid bright spots on the display. Proper lighting adds to your comfort and work efficiency. 
❑ Positioning an external display – When using an external display, set the display at a comfortable viewing distance. 
Make sure the display screen is at or slightly below eye level when you are sitting in front of the monitor.

Using the Battery Pack
✍
Keep the battery pack in your computer while it is directly connected to an AC power source. The battery pack continues to charge while you are using 
the computer.
When the battery pack is running out of power and both the charge and power indicator lights blink, you should either connect the AC adapter to 
recharge the battery pack or shut down your computer and install a fully charged battery pack.
Your computer is supplied with a lithium ion battery pack and can be recharged any time. Charging a partially discharged battery pack does not affect 
the life of battery.
While some software applications or peripheral devices are in use, your computer may not enter Hibernate mode even when the remaining battery life 
becomes short. To avoid loss of data while the computer is running on the battery, you should save your data frequently and manually activate a power 
management mode, such as Sleep or Hibernate.
If the battery pack runs out of power while the computer is in Sleep mode, you will lose all unsaved data. Going back to the previous work state is 
impossible. To avoid loss of data, you should save your data frequently.

impossible. To avoid loss of data, you should save your data frequently.
Mode Description
Normal mode This is the normal state of your computer while it is in use. The green power indicator light is lit while the 
computer is in this mode.
Sleep mode Sleep mode turns off the LCD screen and places the built-in storage device(s) and the CPU into a low power 
consumption mode. The orange power indicator light blinks slowly while your computer is in this mode. Your 
computer comes out of Sleep mode quicker than out of Hibernate mode. However, Sleep mode uses more 
power than Hibernate mode.
Hibernate mode While your computer is in Hibernate mode, the state of the system is saved on the built-in storage device(s) and 
power is turned off. Even when the battery pack runs out of power, no data will be lost. The power indicator light 
is unlit while your computer is in this mode.

Using the Wireless LAN
The Wireless LAN (WLAN) allows your computer to connect to a network through a wireless connection.
The WLAN uses the following IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n standard, which specifies the type of technology used.
See the specifications to find out about the configuration of your computer.
WLAN standard Frequency band Remarks
IEEE 802.11a  5 GHz Available only on models compliant with the IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n standard.
IEEE 802.11b/g 2.4 GHz The IEEE 802.11g standard provides higher-speed communications than the IEEE 802.11b 
standard.
IEEE 802.11n 5 GHz/2.4 GHz On models compliant with the IEEE 802.11b/g/n standard, only the 2.4 GHz band can be used.

Notes on Using the Wireless LAN Function
General notes on using the wireless LAN function
❑ In some countries or regions, using WLAN products may be restricted by the local regulations (e.g. limited number of 
channels).
❑ The IEEE 802.11a standard and the IEEE 802.11n standard are not available on ad-hoc networks.
❑ The 2.4 GHz band, with which wireless LAN devices work, is used by various devices. Although the wireless LAN devices 
use the technology to minimize radio interference from other devices that use the same band, such radio interference may 
cause slower communication speeds and narrower communication ranges or communication failures.
❑ The communication speed and range may vary depending on the following conditions:
❑ Distance between communication devices
❑ Existence of obstacles between devices
❑ Device configuration
❑ Radio conditions
❑ Ambient environment that includes existence of walls and materials of such walls
❑ Software in use
❑ Communications may be cut off depending on radio conditions.
❑ Actual communication speed may not be as fast as the one displayed on your computer.
❑ Deploying WLAN products compliant with different standards that use the same band on the same wireless network may 
reduce the communication speed due to radio interference. Taking this into consideration, WLAN products are designed 
to reduce the communication speed to ensure communications with another WLAN product if it is compliant with a 
different standard that uses the same band. When the communication speed is not as fast as expected, changing the 
wireless channel on the access point may increase the communication speed.

Using the Wireless LAN
Note on the data encryption
The WLAN standard includes the encryption methods: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which is a security protocol, Wi-Fi 
Protected Access 2 (WPA2), and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Proposed jointly by the IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance, both WPA2 
and WPA are specifications of standards based on interoperable security enhancements that increase the level of data 
protection and access control for existing Wi-Fi networks. WPA is designed to be forward compatible with the IEEE 802.11i 
specification. It utilizes the enhanced data encryption Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) in addition to user authentication 
using 802.1X and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Data encryption protects the vulnerable wireless link between 
clients and access points. Besides that, there are other typical LAN security mechanisms to ensure privacy, such as: 
password protection, end-to-end encryption, virtual private networks, and authentication. WPA2, the second generation of 
WPA, provides stronger data protection and network access control and is also designed to secure all versions of 802.11 
devices, including 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n standards, multi-band and multi-mode. In addition, based on the 
ratified IEEE 802.11i standard, WPA2 provides government grade security by implementing the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) FIPS 140-2 compliant AES encryption algorithm and 802.1X-based authentication. WPA2 
is backward compatible with WPA.

BLUETOOTH Security
The BLUETOOTH wireless technology has an authentication function, which allows you to determine with whom you choose 
to communicate. With the authentication function, you can prevent any anonymous BLUETOOTH devices from accessing 
your computer.
The first time two BLUETOOTH devices communicate, a common passkey (a password required for authentication) should 
be determined for both devices to be registered. Once a device is registered, there is no need to re-enter the passkey.

Notes on Using the BLUETOOTH Function
❑ The data transfer rate varies, depending on the following conditions:
❑ Obstacles, such as walls, located between devices
❑ Distance between devices
❑ Material used in walls
❑ Proximity to microwaves and cordless telephones
❑ Radio frequency interference and other environmental conditions
❑ Device configuration
❑ Type of software application
❑ Type of operating system
❑ Use of both wireless LAN and BLUETOOTH functions at the same time on your computer
❑ Size of file being exchanged
❑ Large files may occasionally be corrupted during continuous transfer due to limitations of the BLUETOOTH standard and 
electromagnetic interference in the environment.
❑ All BLUETOOTH devices must be certified to make sure that the applicable standard requirements are maintained. Even 
if standards are met, individual device performance, specifications, and operation procedures can vary. Data exchange 
may not be possible in all situations.
❑ Video and audio may not be synchronized if you play videos on your computer with audio output from a connected 
BLUETOOTH device. This is a frequent occurrence with BLUETOOTH technology and does not indicate a malfunction.
❑ The 2.4 GHz band, with which BLUETOOTH devices or wireless LAN devices work, is used by various devices. Although 
BLUETOOTH devices use the technology to minimize radio interference from other devices that use the same band, such 
radio interference may cause slower communication speeds and shorter distances or communication failures.

Adding and Removing Memory
If you want to expand the functionality of your computer, you can increase the amount of memory by installing optional 
memory modules. Before you upgrade your computer's memory, read the notes and procedures in the following pages. 
Notes on adding/removing memory modules
❑ Be sure to place your computer on a flat surface before adding or removing memory modules.
❑ Be careful when changing memory. Improper installation of memory modules may cause damage to your system. This 
damage may void your manufacturer's warranty.
❑ Only use memory modules that are compatible with your computer. If a memory module is not detected by the computer 
or the Windows operating system becomes unstable, contact the sales dealer or the manufacturer of your memory 
module.
❑ Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage electronic components. Before touching a memory module, ensure the 
following:
❑ The procedures described in this document assume user familiarity with the general terminology associated with 
personal computers and with the safety practice and regulatory compliance requirements for using and modifying 
electronic equipment.
❑ Turn off your computer and disconnect it from its power sources (battery pack and AC adapter) and from any 
telecommunication links, networks, or modems before you remove any cover or panel from the computer. Failure to 
do so may result in personal injury or equipment damage.
❑ ESD can damage memory modules and other components. Install the memory module only at an ESD workstation. 
If such a station is not available, do not work in a carpeted area, and do not handle materials that produce or hold 
static electricity (cellophane wrappers, for example). Ground yourself by maintaining contact with an unpainted metal 
portion of the chassis while performing the procedure.

BLUETOOTH Technology
What should I do if other BLUETOOTH devices cannot find my computer?
❑ Make sure both devices have the BLUETOOTH function enabled.
❑ Make sure the WIRELESS switch is on and the WIRELESS indicator light is lit on your computer.
❑ You cannot use the BLUETOOTH function while your computer is in a power saving mode. Bring the computer back to 
Normal mode, then turn on the WIRELESS switch.
❑ Your computer and the device may be too far apart. Wireless BLUETOOTH technology works best when the devices are 
within 10 meters of each other.
 
What should I do if I cannot find the BLUETOOTH device I want to communicate with?
❑ Check that the BLUETOOTH function of the device you want to communicate with is on. See the other device's manual 
for more information.
❑ If the device you want to communicate with is already communicating with another BLUETOOTH device, it may not be 
found or it may not be able to communicate with your computer.
❑ To allow other BLUETOOTH devices to communicate with your computer, follow these steps:

BLUETOOTH Technology
What should I do if other BLUETOOTH devices cannot connect to my computer?
❑ Check the suggestions in What should I do if I cannot find the BLUETOOTH device I want to communicate with? 
(page 139).
❑ Make sure the other devices are authenticated.
❑ The data transfer distance can be shorter than 10 meters depending on existing obstacles between the two devices, on 
radio wave quality, and on the operating system or the software in use. Move your computer and BLUETOOTH devices 
closer to each other.
 
Why is my BLUETOOTH connection slow?
❑ The data transfer speed depends on the obstructions and/or the distance between the two devices, on the radio wave 
quality, and on the operating system or the software in use. Move your computer and BLUETOOTH devices closer to each 
other.
❑ The 2.4 GHz band, with which BLUETOOTH devices or wireless LAN devices work, is used by various devices. Although 
BLUETOOTH devices use the technology to minimize radio interference from other devices that use the same band, such 
radio interference may cause slower communication speeds and shorter distances or communication failures.
❑ If a version of a BLUETOOTH standard employed on the BLUETOOTH device with which you want to communicate is not 
the same version as the one employed on your computer, the communication speed becomes slower.
 
Why can't I use the services supported by the connected BLUETOOTH device?
Connection is only possible for services also supported by the computer with the BLUETOOTH function. See Windows Help 
and Support for more information.
