                                          Slide the metal mounting clamps onto both ends of       
       the extension arm. Each side is tted with rubber grips  
       that the clamps use for holding support. Be sure as to,   
       at least partially, slide the metal mounting clamps to    
       lay over the rubber grips. Use the dual clamp-style    
       knobs on both sides on each of the mounting clamps   
       to secure the angle and placement of the device    
       resting plate.
Use the included  hardware  to secure the device 
resting plate with the metal mounting clamps.  The 
holes in the mounting clamp brackets should align 
with the holes protruding through the base plate.  
Be sure to use a washer between the wing nut and the 
metal mounting clamp when securing.
The plate bolts are to be inserted  from the top of the 
unit, going downward through the device resting plate, 
and out of the other  end to meet the metal mounting 
brackets. The metal mounting bracket clamps can be 
adjusted or loosened accordingly to allow for angle/tilt 
adjustment.
Slide the assembled extension arm and device resting 
plate into the assembled folding tripod base with the 
inserted  extension arm tting insert. The top clamp 
style knob allow for height adjustment by raising or 
lowering the unit's extension arm. The lower clamp 
style knob allows for securing the stand's stability 
when the tripod legs are extended. 
The unit also features  a safety pin that acts as a backup 
for the stand's height adjustment safety.
