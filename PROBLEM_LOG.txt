## Issues

### RESOLVED: manua.ls PDF Download Challenge
**Date**: November 12, 2025  
**Problem**: manua.ls doesn't provide direct PDF downloads. Site uses pdf2htmlEX to convert PDFs to HTML.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ❌ Direct PDF URL extraction - No PDF files available
2. ❌ Playwright browser automation - Generated corrupted PDFs (HTML saved as PDF)

**Final Solution**: ✅ Text extraction from ALL pages
- Extracts content from each page (e.g., ?p=1, ?p=2, ... ?p=126)
- Preserves formatting and structure
- Much faster than browser automation
- Produces clean, searchable text files
- Successfully tested with 126-page manual → 1,839 lines, 98KB
